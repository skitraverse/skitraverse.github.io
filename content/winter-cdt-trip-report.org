* Summary

I completed the first traverse during wintertime of the Continental Divide of the continental USA. I started hiking from Crazy Cook Monument on November 21st, 2022, a little after noon. I started skiing December 20th, north of Ghost Ranch, NM. I reached the Canadian border on April 15th, around 1330MST, with my partner Lukas S.

But, I was not done. I postponed the heart of the Colorado Rockies and the northern part of the Wind River Range until late spring. First, I headed to the Winds, and afterwards to Colorado.  I finished at the Devil's Thumb Trailhead, near Fraser, Colorado, on June 3rd, 2023, in the evening around 1930MST.
* Route choice

Although inspired by the Continental Divide Trail (CDT), I deviated often from
the CDT to optimize safety, travel speed, and fun. Downhill skiing the CDT is
not much fun, unless there are otherwise too many fallen trees or other
vegetation.  In a few cases, I also took snowmobile trails for faster travel
and, oftentimes, better scenery.

* Verification
  I used the Garmin Inreach Messenger. It worked satisfactorily and the integration with my Garmin Instinct Solar 2 and the Garmin Messenger Android app was not excellent, but satisfactory.
