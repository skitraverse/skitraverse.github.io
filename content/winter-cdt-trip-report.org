* Summary

I completed the first traversal during wintertime of the Continental Divide of
the continental USA. I started hiking on the Continental Divide Trail from
Crazy Cook Monument on November 21st, 2022, a little after noon. I started
skiing December 20th, north of Ghost Ranch, NM. I reached the Canadian border
on April 15th, around 13:30MST, with my partner Lukas S.

I was not yet done. I had postponed the heart of the Colorado Rockies and the
northern part of the Wind River Range until late spring, due to typically
unpredictable avalanche danger. First, I headed to the Winds, and afterwards
to Cumbres Pass, Colorado.  I finished at the Devil's Thumb Trailhead, near
Fraser, Colorado, on June 3rd, 2023, in the evening around 19:30MST.

That makes my endeavor 194 days long, with 25 days of hiking, about 123 days
of ski-touring, about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) traveled on skis. On an
average ski-touring day I walked 8-12 hours, covered 20-25km (12-15 miles)
distance, and climbing 1500-2000m (5000-6500ft) vertical.

I carried all of my food, shelter, and fuel for each section, in
self-supported in typical thru-hiker style.  In a typical week, I would walk 5
days, and rest 2 days. I ate about 1.1kg of food per day. At the beginning of
a typical 5-day ski traverse, my backpack would weigh about 13kg (30lbs).

I suffered no frostbite injuries, no major traumas, and was not caught in an
avalanche.  The coldest times were when I was in the southern Wind River Range
in late January 2023 and when an arctic front blew into the Centennial
Mountains in mid-February 2023. I do not know how cold it was. Some reports
say -25°F (-30°C) with winds of 30mph (50kmh). It was cold.

An epic ski traverse it was. But just as epic was the winter for much of the
Rocky Mountain West! The winter of 2022-2023, a transition season from La Niña
to El Niño, was one of the snowiest and coldest on record for most of the
Rocky Mountain West. I was thankful that I had plenty of snow to ski on, but
getting snowed on often and skinning through fresh snow slowed me
considerably.

I skied a lot of powder.

* Route choice

Although inspired by the Continental Divide Trail (CDT), I deviated often from
the CDT to optimize safety, travel speed, and fun. Downhill skiing the CDT is
not much fun, unless there are otherwise too many fallen trees or other
vegetation.  In a few cases, I also took snowmobile trails for faster travel
and, oftentimes, better scenery.

* Verification
I used the Garmin Inreach Messenger. It worked satisfactorily and the
integration with my Garmin Instinct Solar 2 and the Garmin Messenger Android app
was not excellent, but satisfactory. The Garmin Inreach Messenger does not
record tracks, but merely sends a tracking point to Garmin's satellites at a
preset (10-minute) interval. These 10-minute tracking points are all I have for
formal verification.

* Skipped portions

Going over a mountain versus maintaining elevation and traversing around usually requires the same amount of effort. I rerouted often, but also skipped portions entirely.  
Due to avalanche danger, my unwillingness to walk on the side of a road, my unwillingness to walk a wind-scoured ridge to a pass as opposed to skiing off the ridge, or my need to make a up time, I skipped some of the parts typically considered part of the CDT. I list them in chronological order.

- *Road walk, US-180, turn off to Silver City*: I skipped about 22 units.
- *Road walk, County road A083, north of Pie Town*: I skipped about 20 units.
- *Road walk, Zuni Canyon Road, south of Grants*: I skipped about 8 units.
- *Road walk, NM 197, south of Cuba*: I skipped about 4 units.
- *Road walk, CO 14 and US 40 to Rabbit Ears Pass*: I skipped about 17 units.
- *Road walk, WY HWY 71*: I skipped about 22 units.
- *Ridge walk, east of North Fork, ID*: I skipped about 60 units.
- *Skiing, northern part of the Pintlars*: I skipped about (105-41) 64 units of good skiing.
- *Skiing, Anaconda Cutoff*: I skipped about 207 units of skiing.
- *Trail walk, US 2*: I skipped about 30 units. Excuse:

An overview can be found at https://caltopo.com/m/E0UE6, which contains an import of my GPS-tracks from the Garmin Explore website (blue), and routes of the portions that I skipped (purple).

There are many reasons people have at most attempted only parts of the CDT in wintertime, the most common reason being personal safety. I am the first person to attempt to traverse the entire CDT in wintertime. My example sets the tone for future attempts. Accordingly, in Alpine style, I rerouted almost every day, and postponed critical sections.
