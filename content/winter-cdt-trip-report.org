* Summary

I completed the first traverse during wintertime of the Continental Divide of
the continental USA. I started hiking from Crazy Cook Monument on November
21st, 2022, a little after noon. I reached the Canadian border on April 15th,
around 1330MST, with my partner Lukas S. But, I was not done. I postponed the
heart of the Colorado Rockies and the northern part of the Wind River Range
until late spring. I finished at the Devil's Thumb Trailhead, near Fraser,
Colorado, on June 3rd, 2023, in the evening around 1930MST.
* Route choice

Although inspired by the Continental Divide Trail (CDT), I strayed often from
the CDT to optimize safety, travel speed, and fun. Downhill skiing the CDT is
not much fun, unless there are otherwise too many fallen trees or other
vegetation.  In a few cases, I also took snowmobile trails for faster travel
and, oftentimes, better scenery.

* Verification
  I used the Garmin Inreach Messenger. It worked satisfactorily and the integration with my Garmin Instinct Solar 2 and the Garmin Messenger Android app was not excellent, but satisfactory.
  
My Garmin Mapshare page is: https://share.garmin.com/skitraverse

* Skipped portions

Going over a mountain versus maintaining elevation and traversing around usually requires the same amount of effort. I rerouted often, but also skipped portions entirely.  
Due to avalanche danger, my unwillingness to walk on the side of a road, my unwillingness to walk a wind-scoured ridge to a pass as opposed to skiing off the ridge, or my need to make a up time, I skipped some of the parts typically considered part of the CDT. I list them in chronological order.

- *Road walk, US-180, turn off to Silver City*: I skipped about 22 units. Excuse: I don't like dangerous road walks, especially when I have CoViD-19.
- *Road walk, County road A083, north of Pie Town*: I skipped about 20 units. Excuse: I don't like road walks, especially when I have a sprained ankle.
- *Road walk, Zuni Canyon Road, south of Grants*: I skipped about 8 units. Excuse: I don't like road walks, especially when I have a sprained ankle.
- *Road walk, NM 197, south of Cuba*: I skipped about 4 units. Excuse: I don't like dangerous road walks, especially when I have a sprained ankle.
- *Road walk, CO 14 and US 40 to Rabbit Ears Pass*: I skipped about 17 units. Excuse: I don't like dangerous road walks, especially at night.
- *Road walk, WY HWY 71*: I skipped about 22 units. Excuse: I don't like dangerous road walks.
- *Ridge walk, east of North Fork, ID*: I skipped about 60 units. Excuse: Avalanche danger going through the north and south forks of Sheep Creek. 
- *Skiing, northern part of the Pintlars*: I skipped about (105-41) 64 units of good skiing. Excuse: Avalanche danger! I saw a natural avalanche on the north face East Pintler, with a crown of about 20 feet.
- *Road walk, US 2*: I skipped about 30 units. Excuse: There was not enough time.
- *Road walk, , north of Pie Town*: I skipped about 20 units. Excuse: I don't like dangerous road walks, especially when I have a sprained ankle.

An overview can be found at https://caltopo.com/m/E0UE6, which contains an import of my GPS-tracks (red), and the portions that I skipped (blue).
  
There are many reasons people have at most attempted only parts of the CDT in wintertime, the most common reason being personal safety. I am the first person to attempt to traverse the entire CDT in wintertime. My example sets the tone for future attempts.
