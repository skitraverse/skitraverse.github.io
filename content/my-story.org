* About Brian

I'm a Swiss-certified alpine ski guide who completed the first winter ski traverse of the Continental Divide Trail from Mexico to Canada. But like most expeditions, this one started long before the first step.

** The Journey to the Continental Divide

My relationship with snow began predictably enough: as a kid sledding off the carport roof, one cross-country ski outing with the Boy Scouts, and sporadic snowboarding in the '90s. What changed was college, where I joined the Weber State University Snowboard team and discovered that mountains weren't just playgrounds—they were classrooms.

In 2012, after moving to Switzerland, I started splitboarding in the Alps. The transition from resort riding to backcountry touring opened a new world. By 2015, I was ascending high Alpine peaks in winter and completing multi-day hut-to-hut traverses, learning to read avalanche terrain and weather patterns that could kill you if you got them wrong.

** Certifications & Training

The Swiss Alpine Club doesn't hand out certifications lightly. I earned mine through years of technical training and field experience:

- *2017:* Swiss Alpine Club Backcountry Ski Guide Certification (Tourenleiter I)
- *2021:* Swiss Alpine Club Alpine Ski Guide Certification (Tourenleiter II)
- *2021:* Transitioned from splitboarding to skiing for better efficiency on long traverses

These weren't just pieces of paper. They represented hundreds of days in avalanche terrain, navigation in whiteout conditions, rescue training, and the judgment to turn around when the mountain says no.

** Testing Limits

*2020-2021:* Started pushing into multi-week snow camping traverses, carrying everything needed for extended self-supported travel.

*February-March 2022:* Solo ski traverse of Bulgaria's Pirin and Rila Mountains. Multiple routes, complete winter conditions, alone. This was the proving ground—could I handle isolation, route-finding, and decision-making with no backup?

*November 2022 - June 2023:* The Continental Divide. Started at the Mexican border on November 21st, 2022. Finished at Devil's Thumb Trailhead, Colorado, on June 3rd, 2023. 194 days. 2,200 miles on skis. Solo except for the Montana-Canada section with my partner Lukas. First winter traverse of the Continental Divide from Mexico to Canada.

** What Didn't Work

*2025:* Attempted ski traverses in Japan and Iceland. Both failed due to circumstances beyond my control. Mountains don't care about your plans, and sometimes the answer is no.

** What I Do Now

I live in Rüschlikon, Switzerland, with my wife. I continue to guide in the Alps, contribute to climate change mitigation efforts, and plan future expeditions.

The story is still being written. Preferably in the snow.
