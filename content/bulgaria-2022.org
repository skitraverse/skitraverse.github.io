* Summary from 2022 Trip
  - Sun is strong.
  - Snowline can be high 1000-1800.
  - Wind is constantly blowing.
  - Good conditions in the Alpine are rare when terrain is gentle.
  - Most terrain is gentle.
  - Treeline is high. Pinus mura can be found up to 2500m, but is stunted at this elevation, due to wind.
  - Forests grow thick, large wild rose bushes are common, and fallen branches are everywhere. Bushwhacking is common, and care is needed when skiing in the forest.
  - Map data is readilly available and can be high quality.
  - The hut infrastructure is great. 
  - No helicopter rescue is available as of 2022. 
  - Wildlife sticks to lower elevations.
  - Snow tends to be a little wet 

* Infrastructure
It is often unclear if a certain hut has a warden at a certain
time. Unserviced huts, which are easily accessible e.g. without special
equipment such as those close to ski resorts (Banderitsa Hut) are often
locked. Unserviced alpine huts almost always are unlocked and have a room with
many beds, blankets, and a wood stove, with plenty of wood. Good practice is
to leave the facilities more orderly than found, and slip some money under the
reception door.

Due to the uncertainty and difficulty of a rescue, a conservative approach to
these mountains is advised.

* Wildlife
Wolves have cohabitated Bulgaria with humans since the beginning of our
time. Wolves fear and avoid humans. Likewise, humans fear and avoid
wolves. Mind your manners, and you may have a problem with a dog, but not a
wolf.

I may have seen one wolf, which was interested in a dog, which was following
me and had a limp. The wolf was not interested in me.

I saw a few chamois. Otherwise, I saw many tracks of boar, deer, wolves, but no bear tracks.

* Map Data
Maps of slope angle classes can be inaccurate, maybe due to the lack of ground
truth but are sufficient. I used Gaia GPS, but would not use it here
again. CalTopo has better slope class angles in the Pirin and Rila Mountains
as of writing this in late 2022.

Iskar Tour maps are the best printed option. However, they are very delicate
for use en route, and require forethought how to stow and access them
practically. They can be difficult to obtain outside of Bulgaria.

The website bgmountains.org has routinely updated map tiles for offline use
with a mapping app such as OruxMaps. These are the most detailed electronic
maps for navigating routes in Bulgaria. The download is free, a donation is
cool. They also offer a map tiling service:

The best combination for mapping data, as of writing this in late 2022, would
be to add this tiling service to  your CalTopo layers and combine that with CalTopo's most
accurate slope angle class.
