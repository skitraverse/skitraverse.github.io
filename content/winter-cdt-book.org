* But why a book?

I have written this book for those who helped me along the way, and for my
family and friends. I also write it for lovers of the wilderness, who do not
fear the feeling of insignificance but appreciate it. Some I may even inspire to
attempt some similarly epic ski traverse. Also, for those adventurers who like a
good story and appreciate an example of someone going ahead with their crazy
idea and succeeding, I write this book for you.

The book will have prose interlaced with photos of people and remote places of
the US Rocky Mountains. I will do my absolute best to not disappoint you.

Though very partial, my wife likes my writing style, and, while reading some of the
book, warns me that I won't be going on any such adventures anymore, or even
be leaving the house. I write the book for her as well.
