* This is an extremely dangerous undertaking. Are you crazy?
A wintertime traverse of the CDT could be very dangerous. I am not very
risk-tolerant. With all the tools I have, I can plan out most of the
risk. Furthermore, being in the snow every day gives me insight that I may not
get from an avalanche prognosis.

The mountains will tell me when to stop.

There indeed are some objectively dangerous sections in Colorado, when the
snowpack is weak, which it usually is. I am not loyal to a snow-covered CDT
footpath. I will optimize for safety and fun, taking the route that makes
sense given the conditions. I will pass through this area when it is generally
safe(r).

Ski traverses are my thing. I am past the phase of needing to prove something
to someone. This idea has gripped me. I will pursue it until it is indeed
crazy. Then I will wait and try again. Everytime I study a map, the slope
angle classes, the distances, I feel good. There are usually decent exit
options, alternate routes, and always the option of turning back. I got this.

I say this undertaking is ambitious.

* Do I have to also take scale-based skis?
I think you'd be crazy to take anything else. The minimal downhill
disadvantage is more than made up for by the reduced need to use climbing
skins. You glide better when walking, your skis weigh less without skins, far
fewer transitions are necessary, you can take much narrower and thus lighter skins,
and you make a cool buzzing sound when you descend! What's not to love about
that?

Above all, we need to be on the same page. Scale-based skis are the most
optimal tool for this endeavor. That is, unless you are a skimo racer who
plans to come with toothpicks and you can ski them in 3 feet of powder or
facets safely, and comfortably transition in under a minute, every 10 minutes,
with a heavy pack, and are sure that this won't frustrate you.  Otherwise,
yes, you also need to take scale-based skis. They make narrower ones, and they
make fatter ones.

Let's be on the same page, please.

* How well should I be able to ski?
You should be a pretty good skier. If skiing powder is a challenge, it
will be even harder with a heavy pack pulling you into the back seat. Skiing
breakable crust without proper skill with a heavy pack is injury prone and thus
dangerous. Above all, you should be able to ski safely, even if that is not stylish.

* Why not use cross-country skis?
That may be a good idea. I guess the gear and capabilities of scale-based,
touring skis is just more advanced, that is, lightweight and durable. Also,
the terrain we will be traveling through is too steep for cross-country gear
(and my abilities with cross country skis). If it's an awesome powder day and
we are impeded by avalanche danger, I would probably want to go ride some
powder. I don't have any experience with backcountry cross-country skis, and
consider them to be too specialized for this undertaking.

* I'm taking my splitboard, ok?
No. It's too inefficient, in my experience. Even with a split-tech system, the
lightest scale-based board, and world-class condition, you'll be too great of a
drag.

I was a splitboarder. People on skis were keeping up with me, who should not
have been able to. The efficiency hit is big. I learned to ski because of
that. Long ski traverses were more important to me than the ultimate fun on the
downhill.  On a traverse, the sum of type I-fun is greater with
skis. Furthermore, the sum of type II-fun is less with skis.

The less efficient you are, the more food you have to eat, the more food and
fuel you have to take, the heavier your pack, the slower you are, the less
efficient you are...

* What if the mother of all storms broadsides us?
We will track weather. Say if we were somehow impeded, and had to hunker down,
we would dig into the snow. In a snowcave, we can regulate the temperature
very well.

This used to be my preferred shelter, by the way. On a long traverse, it is
too much work to be sustainable.

If it's obvious that we will be impeded, we could exit to the nearest town to
wait for conditions to settle. We could also adjust our route to avoid risky
situations, and still hopefully be able to ski the trees.

I plan an extra 30 to 45 days waiting for safe conditions.
* How do we handle emergency situations?
We don't get into such situations in the first place. We need to have enough
conditioning and skill that we are well within our limits so that we can
comfortably handle the situation at hand.

Should bad luck happen, our skill must suffice to stabilize the situation and
hunker down or exit.

Avalanche: We must not get into an avalanche. We will carry avalanche gear,
but we must not need to use it, unless to help another party.

Gear failure: We fix it to the best of our abilities (pole breaks, binding
rips out, sleeping pad pops) and exit if it's critical and irrepairable (MSR
Reactor overheats).

Social failure: If we're a pair or a triplet, we stick together no matter
what, until reasonable departure is reached i.e. a town or someone with
transportation means. We exit prematurely. 

Injury: There is a huge body of literature and many courses available. The WFR
course should suffice; take one. We'll figure things out given the situation. We prepare
ourselves to not sustain an injury, and handle a situation if the worst happens.

* Why not use a reliable alcohol stove?
I tried my best with the Trail Designs Ti-Tri System. It works and is very
dependable, at altitude and in the cold. It's awesome. And canisters are a
pain in the neck.

But the pinnacle of Trail Designs work is fiddly, slow, and stinks like
hell. In the end, it is also heavier. For a 10-day ski traverse, I need 1.2
liters of ethanol, plus the 400g kit (Toaks 1.3L pot). That will total around
1.6kg. If I take the MSR reactor (490g), with a 450g gas canister (650g), and
the MSR DeepDish bowl (60g) to warm the canister with water, I get better
performance at a lower weight (1.2kg).

But this relationship tips even more in favor of the Reactor, if I have a
partner. Because the Reactor is so fast and with the 1.7L pot size, my
partners only need to carry their gas. The ti-tri would require each partner
to carry their own system to melt snow within a reasonable time. 

The two-person total starting weight comparison tallies Ti-Tri at about 3.2kg
and MSR Reactor system at about 2kg.

The ending weight after 10 days of awesomeness? The alcohol setup is
lighter. One-person end weight of the Tri-tri: 400g, MSR Reactor 750g;
two-person end weight, Ti-Tri: 800g, MSR Reactor 950. If we have three people?
We break even (Ti-Tri 1200g, Reactor 1150g).

But at the end of the awesome 10-day traverse, our packs are empty. All the
time and frustration saved justifies the minimal end weight penalty, even if
I'm alone. The time saved, the starting weight advantage, when everything is
heavier, the ability to comfortably cook in a cabin, tent, or snow cave make
this an easy decision to take the MSR Reactor for winter outings.

If we're sure we have continued access to water the ti-tri wins out, if we're
melting snow, the MSR Reactor is my choice.

* How do we resupply?
We use the normal Post Offices that help out thru-hikers in summertime. Some
are closed in winter, so we need to plan around that. Also, we have a lot of
really nice, selfless people support us with food and fuel caches, or we cache
things ourselves. And we send them thanks and best wishes and cards and
chocolates etc.  We may consider caches for certain remote sections in Montana
and Wyoming.


* In how good of physical condition should I be?
There are two aspects to this. First is the obvious need to be aerobically
well-conditioned i.e. hike all day every day for months. Considerable strength
is also necessary to deal with the weight of the heavier pack. You should be
very injury-resistant. The book 'Training for the Uphill Athlete' is our
training manual.

* What about mental strength?
You should be in good mental shape. Impediments, harsh weather, deep
snow, edgy partners and fatigue are all part of the game. They gnaw at your
mental strength. They can pull you off center. They can disproportionately
subtract from the immense beauty and serenity of the winter landscape. If you
snap, you are in a harsh environment with many objective dangers without your
wits. If you are not skilled at centering yourself, at righting your keeling
ship, this endeavor will not be fun and may be very dangerous. 

We all have our techniques. Additionally, I strongly recommend Vipassana
meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka. Ego is a weakness.
