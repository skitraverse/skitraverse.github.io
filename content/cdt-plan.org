** Path
November 15th until Christmas, I plan to walk north from the Mexican border
and stop on December 23rd to go spend Christmas with family. During these down
days, we need to decide whether we will flip-flop or continue northward. Flip-flop: on
December 27th, I plan to start driving to the Canadian border and continue
southwards from there.

Why flip-flop? I have three good reasons. First, I will not walk through
sketchy avalanche conditions. Persistent weak layers are very common for a
Colorado snowpack. Southern and central Colorado tend to have a stable
snowpack sometime in March or April. Faceted weak layers are to be taken dead
seriously. Walking in the hot New Mexican sun in May doesn't sound very
appealing either. Very likely, I wouldn't be able to ski much in May, anyways.

Second, I don't want to be dealing with hungry, emaciated critters, possibly
with young, in Montana in April or May. I would rather deal with the heavy snowfalls in
January (average 20 days of snowfall) and enjoy the powder while waiting for
the snow to settle!

Third, and probably most importantly, I don't have a partner yet. The three weeks
leading up to Christmas will serve as an extended trail date for anyone who
chooses to join me. We will work out our routines and quirks by Christmas, I
hope. We can go for an FKT for the New Mexican portion and get our legs and backs
ready for the hard part up north.

Alternatively, if the snowpacks in Colorado look inviting, we will keep
heading North. Walking up in the Sun and skiing down the soft north faces is
the most fun. We could consider skipping over Colorado to Wyoming and coming
back in Spring.
** Principles
1. Safety first.
   - If we need to wait out a vicious storm cycle in a ski town, we ride
     powder until the snow settles. I carry a helmet, ice axe, beacon, probe,
     proper shovel, ski goggles, satellite transceiver, etc. Safety first.
2. Proper planning.
   - Food, fuel, weather, and above all time planning are our tools.
3. Speed is safety.
   - Weather changes, gear fails, people fall ill. Speed is our
     friend. Slowness begets slowness. We need to be fast. 2000 vertical feet
     (600 meters) gain per hour with a load (10kg) and a good track should be possible when needed.
4. Redundant systems.
   - Redundancy in navigation, shelter, and sleeping systems is important.
5. Social coherence trumps fun.
   - We stick together.
6. Rest is very important.
   - We need to ensure we can handle a 10-day traverse in deep snow. Thorough nightly rest is important.

** Systems
- Light backcountry skis with scaled bases and climbings skins. Scaled bases are necessary for efficient.
  - I am open to backcountry cross country skis for certain sections. But I
    trust lightweight touring skis and can comfortably skate with them. 
- Tent with solid inner. Probably the Tarptent Stratospire Li.
  - I have tried building a snow cave every night. It is too much work. 
- Zipperless down sleeping bag (-20Â°F) with DCF vapor barrier
  clothing. Timmermade gear serves me very well.
  - I have tried extending all the 3-season ultralight systems for winter and
    failed. This is my current trusted system.
- Melt snow, heat water: MSR reactor with hanging kit. An (additional) option
  is using a foldable Nalgene cantene between the back and backpack (and
  combine no cook with cold soak). It is essential to plan in water collection
  at flowing waters.
  - I have tried the trail designs fissure alcohol systems for winter
    traverses. They work well, but are fidgety, slow, and unsafe to use in
    tent. I think the MSR reactor works better for the weight and is more
    versatile (cook/hang in tent, fuel-to-snow-melted ratio).

** Finances
Without the gear investments (about 8k$ upfront!), I would budget
10k$. Weather-driven stays in town are a variable that may inflate that
number. I still need to research what permits will be necessary for certain sections.

** People
Myself: Experienced alpine winter backcountry *tour* guide, splitboarder,
skier, powder hound, climate activist.  I am 37 years old, a climate scientist
turned firmware engineer, a little over 6' (184cm), 75kg, and injury-resistant
and well-conditioned. I was born in New Mexico, and live in Switzerland with
my wife, with no kids.

I have been out in the snow since 2015 every winter for ski touring >50 days
each season.  For weight and efficiency reasons, I learned how to ski
recently, after 9 years of snowboarding and 9 years of splitboarding. Skis
just make more sense for traverses; therefore, I ski.

I have never walked any of the long trails. I plan to when I am older. I have
done multiple ski traverses in Switzerland and Bulgaria.  I truly enjoy being
out in the wild, especially in winter.  My favorite thing to do are ski
traverses. I view an attempt to walk the CDT in winter as a string of ski
traverses.


You: Experienced winter backcountry *ski* tourer. You should be passionate about
winter, cold-resistant, have a positive outlook and be full of energy.  

** Next steps
Let's talk. We should take one of the [[https://UphillAthlete.com][Uphill Athlete]] courses (probably the [[https://uphillathlete.com/grand-traverse-ski-training-plan/][12
Week Grand Traverse Training Plan]]) together at the very least.
