* Plan
Sometime between November 15th and December 1st until Christmas, I plan to
walk north from the Mexican border. I plan to stop on December 23rd to go spend
Christmas with family. During these down days, we need to decide whether we
will continue northward, skip ahead and come back either from where we stopped
for Christmas or north of whereever it makes sense. I would like to start
gently, to make sure that Christmas time is enough recovery for the next
steps.

Why start in the South and why skip around? I have four reasons. First, I will
not walk through sketchy avalanche conditions. Persistent weak layers are very
common for a Colorado snowpack. Southern and central Colorado tend to have a
stable snowpack sometime in March or April. Faceted weak layers are to be
taken dead seriously. Walking in the hot New Mexican sun in May doesn't sound
very appealing either. Very likely, I wouldn't be able to ski much in May,
anyways.

Second, I don't want to be dealing with hungry, emaciated critters, possibly
with young, in Montana (especially Glacier NP) or Wyoming (Yellowstone NP) in
April or May. I would rather deal with the heavy snowfalls in January (average
20 days of snowfall) and enjoy the powder while waiting for the snow to
settle! This problem is overstated. Bears and wolves usually mind their
business. Habituated, problematic animals are usually caused by careless
humans. It is something to keep in mind. Startling a bear while skiing down or
up is possibly a dangerous situation. 

Third, it is better to walk up warm, crusty, and usually more stable southern
faces in the sun, and ski quickly through colder, softer northerly aspects, where weak
layers lurk and safety distances are easily maintained.

Fourth, and probably most importantly, I don't have a partner yet. The five
weeks leading up to Christmas will serve as an extended trail date for anyone
who chooses to join me. We will work out our routines and quirks by Christmas,
I hope. Also, on the New Mexican portion, we can get our legs and backs ready
for the fun skiing part up north.

Alternatively, if the snowpacks in Colorado look inviting, we will keep
heading North. Walking up in the Sun and skiing down the soft north faces is
the most fun. We will consider skipping over Colorado to Wyoming and coming
back in Spring, if we have weak layers. If we start on November 15th, it is
possible that we'll make it to central Colorado by Christmas. Being past the
San Juans by then would be a relief to me, knowing that the notoriously bad
snowpack would be behind us. If it's a low snow year, we still may not have
been able to ski. I hope for plenty of snow and a stable snowpack in Colorado.

* Path and Terrain
The terrain along the CDT is typically mellow, avoiding the common ski
objectives which are often a short distance away. I plan on deviating from the
classical CDT path to avoid avalanche risks and to chase good snow. This will
depend also on my partners. 

For example, the CDT path through the Wind River range could not be more
gentle given the surrounding terrain. I guess that by the time we get there,
we may be itching for more ambitious path. We'll see then and there what makes
sense.

* Principles
1. Safety first.
   - If we need to wait out a vicious storm cycle in a ski town, we ride
     powder until the snow settles. I carry a helmet, ice axe, beacon, probe,
     proper shovel, ski goggles, satellite transceiver, etc. Safety first.
2. Proper planning.
   - Food, fuel, weather, and above all time planning are our tools.
3. Speed is safety.
   - Weather changes, gear fails, people fall ill. Speed is our
     friend. Slowness begets slowness. We need to be fast. 2000 vertical feet
     (600 meters) gain per hour with a load (10kg) and a good track should be possible when needed.
4. Redundant systems.
   - Redundancy in navigation, shelter, and sleeping systems is important.
5. Social coherence trumps fun.
   - We stick together within reason.
6. Rest is very important.
   - We need to ensure we can handle a 10-day traverse in deep snow. Thorough
     nightly rest is important.

* Systems
- Light backcountry skis with scaled bases and climbings skins. Scaled bases are necessary for efficient.
  - I am open to backcountry cross country skis for certain sections. But I
    trust lightweight touring skis and can comfortably skate with them. 
- Tent.  My choice: HMG UltaMid 2. Candidates: Tarptent Stratospire Li shell, Durston X-mid 2 shell (or Pro gutted)
  - Also, I have tried digging a snow cave every night. It is too much work. 
- Zipperless down sleeping bag (-20Â°F) with DCF vapor barrier 
  clothing. Timmermade gear serves me very well.
  - I have tried extending all the 3-season ultralight systems for winter and
    failed. This is my current trusted system.
- Melt snow, heat water: MSR reactor. An (additional) option is using a
  foldable Nalgene cantene between the back and backpack (and combine no cook
  with cold soak). It is essential to plan in water collection at flowing
  waters. Otherwise, we carry too much fuel.
  - I have tried the trail designs fissure alcohol systems for winter
    traverses. They work well, but are fidgety, slow, and stink too much to use in a
    tent. I think the MSR reactor works better for the weight and is more
    versatile (cook/hang in tent, fuel-to-snow-melted ratio). 50g of fuel per person per day.

* Finances
Without the gear investments (about 8k$ upfront!), I would budget
10k$. Weather-driven stays in town are a variable that may inflate that
number. I still need to research what permits will be necessary for certain sections.

* People
Myself: Experienced alpine winter backcountry *tour* guide, splitboarder,
skier, powder hound, climate activist.  I am 37 years old, a climate scientist
turned firmware engineer, a little over 6' (184cm), 75kg, and injury-resistant
and well-conditioned. I was born in New Mexico, and live in Switzerland with
my wife, with no kids.

I have been out in the snow since 2015 every winter for ski touring >50 days
each season.  For weight and efficiency reasons, I learned how to ski
recently, after 9 years of snowboarding and 9 years of splitboarding. Skis
just make more sense for traverses; therefore, I ski.

I have never walked any of the long trails. I plan to when I am older. I have
done multiple ski traverses in Switzerland and Bulgaria.  I truly enjoy being
out in the wild, especially in winter.  My favorite thing to do is a ski
traverse. I view an attempt to walk the CDT in winter as a string of ski
traverses.


You: Experienced winter backcountry *ski* tourer. You should be passionate about
winter, cold-resistant, have a positive outlook and be full of energy.  

* Fundraiser
I sure would like to take the opportunity set a fundraiser challenge and have
people join me in donating money to a cause. My best idea is to find an
organization the supports less fortunate communities to build out their
renewable energy mix, with the goal of long-term energy autonomy. I am open to
ideas. I guess I'd donate a dollar per mile progress.

* Interested in joining me?
I will only do the CDT in winter if I have a partner. If you are interested,
please read through [[../responses-to-obvious-questions][responses to obvious questions]], and take time to reflect
and decide.  Let's talk. We should take one of the [[https://UphillAthlete.com][Uphill Athlete]] courses
(probably the [[https://uphillathlete.com/grand-traverse-ski-training-plan/][12 Week Grand Traverse Training Plan]]) together at the very
least.
