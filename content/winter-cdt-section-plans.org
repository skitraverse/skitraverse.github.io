* Introduction

I list a rough time plan for my northbound ski traverse alond the
Continental Divide of the western USA. I will attempt to update my progress
and have it reflected here, when possible.

* Route choice

I aim to plan a route that will go 95% of the time given the likelihood that
the snowpack will be weak and instable. I rely on accurate slope angle
classes. I am routinely trying to optimize these routes to have better and
safer skiing. Of course, I am planning bail routes. If the bail routes aren't
there yet, they are either very obvious, or I haven't planned them yet.

* Alpine units used here

I define an alpine unit as 1km horizontal distance or 100m vertical
ascent, which usually takes 15 minutes to travel. For the total units, for a
given distance, I count only the hard ones. That is, I count the distance and
the units uphill. This is a conservative approach; ideally the distances
traveled down, when skiing, are dreamy and easy. I calibrated these numbers
based on my past trips. I use these as a basis, even though I am in much
better shape, my kit is lighter, my skis are better, and my route planning
more exact. I expect these estimates to be accurate. 

* My plans

Update 2023-01-16: *2 days behind*
Update 2023-02-15: *6 days behind, but postponing northern Wind River Traverse until early April, so two days behind until Canada, and 6 days behind Colorado restart date*
Update 2023-05-01: *Starting the final Colorado section today*
Update 2023-06-03: *Finished!*
