* Introduction
  I list a rough time plan for my northbound ski traverse alond the Continental Divide of the western USA. I will attempt to update my progress and have it reflected here, when possible.

* Route choice 
I aim to plan a route that will go 95% of the time given the likelihood that
the snowpack will be weak and instable. I rely on accurate slope angle
classes. I am routinely trying to optimize these routes to have better and
safer skiing. Also, I am planning bail routes. If the bail routes aren't there
yet, they are either very obvious, or I haven't planned them yet.
* Alpine units used here
Again I define an alpine unit as 1km horizontal distance or 100m vertical
ascent, which usually takes 15 minutes to travel. For the total units, for a
given distance, I count only the hard ones. That is, I count the distance and
the units uphill. This is a conservative approach; ideally the distances
traveled down, when skiing, are dreamy and easy. I calibrated these numbers
based on my past trips. I use these as a basis, even though I am in much
better shape, my kit is lighter, my skis are better, and my route planning
more exact. I expect these estimates to be conservative, but also want to be
realistic.
