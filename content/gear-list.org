* Why all the fuss
Winter needs alot more stuff to deal with the elements. Adding the whole ski
touring set up usually doubles the necessary winter weight. Everything I have
chosen has been highly scrutinized, but I am not attached to gear. Show me a
better way, please.

* Remarks
- Skis: I may go with Voile HyperVector BC skis, but that depends a bit on my partner: narrow Objective BCs (84mm) for efficiency, mid-fat (96mm) HyperVectors for fun.
- Alpine unit: 1km horizontal distance or 100m vertical ascent
