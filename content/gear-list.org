* Why all the fuss

Winter needs more stuff to deal with the elements. Adding the whole ski
touring set up usually doubles the necessary winter weight. Everything I have
chosen has been highly scrutinized, but I am not attached to gear. Show me a
better way, please.

* Remarks

- Skis: SkiTrab Ortles 90.
- Ski bindings: Ski Trabs are the simplest and most featured binding, while being light enough. I use the Gara binding. I will carry an extra toe and will be able to remount a torn-out binding.
- Alpine unit: 1km horizontal distance or 100m vertical ascent, usually takes 15 minutes to travel.
- Sleeping bag: I am open to sharing a sleeping bag, as long as we are on the same page regarding vapor barrier clothing or a hot tent. I have a Spoonbill UL from Feathered Friends to offer.
- Tent: Sharing a tent would help reduce weight. A hot tent would be sweet. I can offer a Hyperlite
  Mountain Gear Ultamid 4, and a Durston X-mid 2 with a solid inner. I would
  say the X-mid would require the least work in the evening and will perform
  the best in wind. Without the inner, we can fit 3 people.
