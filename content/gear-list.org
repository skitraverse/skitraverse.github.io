* Why all the fuss
Winter needs alot more stuff to deal with the elements. Adding the whole ski
touring set up usually doubles the necessary winter weight. Everything I have
chosen has been highly scrutinized, but I am not attached to gear. Show me a
better way, please.

* Remarks
- Skis: I may go with Voile HyperVector BC skis, but that depends a bit on my partner: lean Objective BCs (84mm) for efficiency, mid-fat (96mm) HyperVectors for fun.
- Alpine unit: 1km horizontal distance or 100m vertical ascent, usually takes 15 minutes to travel.
- Sleeping bag: I am open to sharing a sleeping bag, as long as we are on the same page regarding vapor barrier clothing. I have a Spoonbill UL from Feathered Friends to offer.
- Tent: Sharing a tent would help reduce weight. I can offer a Hyperlite Mountain Gear Ultamid 2, Ultamid 4, and a Durston X-mid 2 with a solid inner. I would say the X-mid would require the least work in the evening and will perform the best in wind. Without the inner, we can fit 3 people.
- Ski bindings: Ski Trabs are the best. It would be handy to carry an extra toe and/or heel, but I'd leave them at home.
