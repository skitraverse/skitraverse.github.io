<b>The firsthand account of the first winter ski traverse of the Continental Divide Trail</b>
</p>

<p>
From November 21st, 2022 to June 3rd, 2023, I completed what no one had done before: a winter traversal of the Continental Divide through the Rocky Mountains, from the Mexican border to Canada. This is the story of 194 days in the wilderness, 2,200 miles on skis, and one person's attempt to answer a wild calling.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
On November 21st, 2022, I stood at Crazy Cook Monument on the New Mexico-Mexico border with a simple goal: traverse the Continental Divide in winter. What followed were 194 days that tested every limit I thought I had.
</p>

<p>
The first month I hiked through New Mexico's high desert, waiting for snow. By December 20th, near Ghost Ranch, I strapped on skis and didn't take them off for the next four months. Each day meant 8-12 hours of movement, climbing 1,500-2,000 meters (5,000-6,500 feet) vertical, carrying everything I needed to survive.
</p>

<p>
The winter of 2022-2023 was a transition year from La Niña to El Niño - one of the snowiest and coldest on record for the Rocky Mountain West. Wyoming experienced its snowiest winter on record in multiple locations. I was thankful for plenty of snow to ski on, though constant storms and deep powder slowed progress considerably.
</p>

<p>
The southern Wind River Range in late January brought the coldest conditions of the traverse. An arctic front blasted the Centennial Mountains in mid-February with reports of -25°F (-30°C) and 30mph winds. I postponed Colorado's high peaks and the northern Winds until late spring, unwilling to gamble against unpredictable avalanche conditions.
</p>

<p>
On April 15th, 2023, I reached the Canadian border at Waterton with my partner Lukas S. But I wasn't finished. I returned south to complete what I'd skipped: the Wind River high country, then Colorado's technical terrain. On June 3rd, 2023, around 7:30pm, I finished at Devil's Thumb Trailhead near Fraser, Colorado.
</p>

<p>
In total: 194 days covering 5,000 kilometers, with 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) traveled on skis. I suffered no frostbite injuries, no major traumas, and was not caught in an avalanche - though I intentionally triggered one.

<h3 id="org1b7746d"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Why This Book Matters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
I didn't write this for glory or record books. I wrote it for the people who helped me along the way - the trail angels, the friends who resupplied me, my family who supported a crazy idea. I wrote it for wilderness lovers who don't fear insignificance but embrace it. And for anyone who has ever wondered: <i>What if I just tried?</i>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-1">
<p>
This was the first continuous winter ski traverse of the Continental Divide from Mexico to Canada. While sections have been skied before, no one had previously completed the entire route during a single winter season, carrying full winter camping gear and food for multi-week sections.

<h4 id="org5c8e9f0"><span class="section-number-4">1.5.2.</span> How dangerous was it?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-2">
<p>
Extremely. Avalanche risk, hypothermia, frostbite, and complete isolation were constant companions. I spent weeks without seeing another person. The book doesn't shy away from the close calls and poor decisions that nearly ended the journey.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-3">
<p>
I hold Swiss Alpine Club backcountry and alpine ski guide certifications (Tourenleiter I &amp; II). I've completed multi-week traverses in the Alps and Bulgaria. But nothing fully prepares you for 194 consecutive days in winter conditions. <a href="https://skitraverse.com/info/my-story/">See my full background</a>.

No. While the physical challenge is real, the book is fundamentally about decision-making, solitude, fear, and what happens when you strip away everything comfortable. It's for anyone who appreciates honest storytelling about pushing boundaries.
