&lt;h2 id="orgf915b06"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Expedition style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let me establish two approaches to a ski traverses longer than a week, as I
understand them. The classical approach is similar to a polar expedition. This
expedition style entails harnessing a heavy (&amp;gt;1kg) sled that cannot be

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let me establish two approaches to a ski traverses longer than a week, as I
understand them. The classical approach is similar to a polar expedition. This
expedition style entails harnessing a heavy (&amp;gt;1kg) sled that cannot be
practically carried, taking a lot of liquid fuel, a smaller pack, and
making an average progress each day of 8-40km, summing up and down. Ski tours
are loops starting at basecamp when the time is right.  Passable terrain is
limited by the skill to handle the heavy sled, but is practically limited to
mellow terrain with few obstacles. The range of total distances covered can be
very high (1000km), strongly depending on conditions. Weight is always an
issue, but there's a sled. This approach is great for long-lived basecamps in
remote places.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgf0840e4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgf0840e4"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Alpine style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will focus here on the application of alpinism's 'light and fast' style to
ski traverses. I'll call them alpine style ski traverses.  The key
difference between expedition style and alpine style is speed. Alpine style
assumes speedy sustained progress, typically twice as fast as expedition
style. The choices of gear are important, as weight heavily influences
speed. Training requires a solid aerobic base, upon which a lot of training
with a heavy pack can be done in the off season.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Alpine style ski traverses entail carrying everything in a large, yet light and
compressible backpack, possibly with a small (&amp;lt;1kg) packable sled (e.g. a
boggy, see &lt;a href="http://www.johnbaldwin.ca/trip-planning-toboggan.asp"&gt;http://www.johnbaldwin.ca/trip-planning-toboggan.asp&lt;/a&gt;) when
starting.  Average progress each day can vary wildly from 10km to 50km per
day, summing up and down. Passable terrain is limited by each group member's
ability to ski with a loaded pack. The range of distances to be covered are
moderate to high (100 to 500km) between resupplies, are limited by the speed
of the group and their ability to carry the sustaining food and fuel, and, of
course, are strongly dependent on conditions. Weight is a core issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The alpine style allows access to the much steeper terrain. Thinking of
forward progress in distance is not useful. I'll define an 'alpine unit' based
on the military approximation, but is taught in certain German circles as a
"Leistungskilometer" (effort kilometer). I was taught the same concept but the
word "Einheit" (unit) was used.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The concept of an alpine unit hinges on the assumption that one kilometer of
distance requires the same amount of effort and time as a hundred meters of
altitude gain.  &lt;b&gt;The alpine unit equates 100m vertical gain with 1000m
distance.&lt;/b&gt; A handy calculation for imperial units is difficult on the fly, so
roughly convert vertical feet to meters. Also, overlaying the UTM grid (1km by
1km) on a map allows for relatively precise determination of distance, without
the aid of digital technology. A good first approximation for the time
necessary for an alpine unit is 15 minutes or 4 units per hour. Although
individuals may be much faster, the time taken for a unit must be
constantly observed and used for planning forward progress both in the short
and long terms. Note, an old and wise mountain guide says that this equation
needs modification when the terrain is very flat (&amp;lt;5°) or very steep
(&amp;gt;35°). When it is flat, only consider the distance, when it is steep, only
consider the height.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The number of alpine units sustained per day over the course of a week is an
important result of reflection when planning the next ski traverse. A first
approximation of this sustained progress could be half of the normal alpine
units done on a day's ski tour. If you are strong with a heavy pack, take 3/4
of the speed on a day's ski tour. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Alpine style ski traverses allow for continuous replanning of the route, fast
exits, avoidance or mitigation of bad weather, and, my favorite, complete
immersion in a mountain range. This is the approach of the pioneers of ski
traverses, light and therefore fast and nimble. Bill Briggs did not have a
sled on the Bugaboo to Rogers Traverse. With the constantly improving
lightweight gear, improving map material, denser weather observation networks,
improved remote sensing data availability and access, this practice can become
safer and more enjoyable with time, especially when experience allows you to
whittle down your kit, and you condition yourself further.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb70dcc5" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgb70dcc5"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; My alpine style ski traverses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my case, my pack can weigh a maximum of about 25kg, including skis, and I
am still having fun. I aim for 40 units per day, which assumes some poor
conditions and some good conditions for progress. My daily progress on my ski
traverse in Bulgaria averaged at about alpine 45 units per day sustained over
8 days, including a rest day. That's not fast, but it suffices to cover
considerable ground (360 alpine units total). I used 106mm wide skis
and freeride bindings. I could have been faster with narrower skis, lighter
bindings, or scale-based skis. I have much room to learn and improve.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am thankful for the concise book on winter mountaineering 'Bergsport Winter'
in German. I am most thankful for all my mentor's and friend's guidance and
patience. They were pivotal in aiding me to develop the necessary skills of
determining avalanche risk, orienteering in all conditions, detailed map study
and route planning, as well as little bits of information to make prolonged
stays in the often harsh winter landscape enjoyable. They continue to be very
helpful and good company. Thank you!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mid-February to mid-March&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sun is strong.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Treeline is high. &lt;i&gt;Pinus mura&lt;/i&gt; can be found up to 2500m, but is stunted at this elevation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forests grow thick. Large wild rose bushes are common. Fallen branches are everywhere. Bushwhacking is common, and care is needed when skiing in the forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map data is readily available and can be high quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hut infrastructure and hut culture is great, often better than that of the Alps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No helicopter rescue is available as of 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wildlife sticks to lower elevations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snow tends to be a little wet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book &lt;a href="https://www.skiingthebalkans.com/"&gt;Skiing the Balkans&lt;/a&gt; by Dimitar Dimitrov is very useful as an introduction to backcountry skiing in Bulgaria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buses, trains, and hitchhiking (if you speak Bulgarian) work well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org62175bc" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org62175bc"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is often unclear if a certain hut has a warden at a certain
time. Unserviced huts, which are easily accessible e.g. without special
equipment such as those close to ski resorts (Banderitsa Hut) are often
locked. Unserviced alpine huts almost always are unlocked and have a room with
many beds, blankets, and a wood stove, with plenty of wood. Good practice is
to leave the facilities more orderly than found, and slip some money under the
locked door of the warden's office.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Due to the uncertainty and difficulty of a rescue, a conservative approach to
these mountains is advised. No helicopter rescue is available as of 2022.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org510866f" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org510866f"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Map Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Maps of slope angle classes can be inaccurate, maybe due to the lack of ground
truth data, but are sufficient. I recommend CalTopo because it has better slope class angles in the Pirin and Rila Mountains than competing offers, as of writing this in late 2022.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Iskar Tour maps are the best printed option. However, they are very delicate
for use en route, and require forethought how to stow and access them
practically. They can be difficult to obtain outside of Bulgaria.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The website bgmountains.org has routinely updated map tiles for offline use
with a mapping app such as CalTopo. These are the most detailed electronic
maps for navigating routes in Bulgaria. The download is free, so a donation is
recommended. They also offer a map tiling service at &lt;a href="https://kade.si"&gt;https://kade.si&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
&lt;pre class="src src-nil"&gt;https://bgmtile.kade.si/{Z}/{X}/{Y}.png 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The best combination for mapping data, as of writing this in late 2022, would be
to add this tiling service to your CalTopo layers and combine that with
CalTopo's most accurate slope angle class. A wiser me takes PDF printouts of my
CalTopo custom maps, when CalTopo or my phone fails to work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For example, my notes help me to hit the ground running, as well as &lt;a href="https://caltopo.com/m/6JPNRK1"&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; them with you.
&lt;a href="https://caltopo.com/m/6JPNRK1"&gt;https://caltopo.com/m/6JPNRK1&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wolves have cohabitated Bulgaria with humans since the beginning of our
time. Wolves fear and avoid humans. Likewise, humans fear and avoid
wolves. Mind your manners, and you may have a problem with a dog, but not a
wolf.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I may have seen one wolf, which was interested in a dog, which was following
me and had a limp. The wolf was not interested in me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I saw a few chamois. Otherwise, I saw many tracks of boar, deer, wolves, but no bear tracks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org309ce5e"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Timing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of all things, the timing and sequence of a ski traverse of the US Continental Divide is where flexibility will be necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Currently, I see two options, and list them in order of my preference. I would
start northbound mid-November, most likely exiting at Cumbres Pass, Colorado,
but …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-org309ce5e" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org309ce5e"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Timing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of all things, the timing and sequence of a ski traverse of the US Continental Divide is where flexibility will be necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Currently, I see two options, and list them in order of my preference. I would
start northbound mid-November, most likely exiting at Cumbres Pass, Colorado,
but possibly continuing northward until the avalanche conditions become too
unpredictable. Another less preferable option, but possibly the only reasonable
option for a continuous footpath border to border, would be to start southbound
sometime in January or February, with the goal of being in Grand Lake, Colorado
by early April.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Why the two options? The technical crux of wintertime CDT is the combination
of steep terrain of central and southern Colorado and notoriously weak
snowpack. This area is reserved for the late springtime.  Past Grand Lake and
the Front Range, the CDT begins to mellow, and the snowpack thickens.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why is starting southbound mid-Winter my second preference? In general, it is
better to walk up warm, crusty, and usually more stable southern faces in the
sun, and ski quickly through colder, softer northerly aspects, where weak layers
lurk and safety distances are easily maintained. Thus, the disadvantages would
be missing a considerable amount of powder, hiking in the coldest temps on the
mountain (only bad when it's frigid), hiking on the most dangerous aspects of
the mountain (increasing the time of exposure to risk), possibly hiking up with
crampons and skis on my back and having to walk down the barren southern slope,
and, finally, being in New Mexico in June, a hot and windy place at that time of
year. None of those are dealbreakers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org68d7008" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org68d7008"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Path and Terrain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The terrain along the CDT is typically mellow, and avoids the common ski
objectives that are often a short distance away. For example, the CDT path
through the Wind River range could not be more gentle given the surrounding
terrain. Plan on deviating from the snow-covered CDT to avoid avalanche risks
and to chase good snow. This way the fun remains.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Above all, being loyal to a snow-covered footpath brings danger and unnecessary toil.
The following principles keep it fun and safer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orga19942c" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orga19942c"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety first.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we need to wait out a storm cycle, we ride
powder or rest until the snow settles. I carry a helmet, ice axe, beacon, probe,
proper shovel, ski goggles, satellite transceiver, etc. Safety first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper planning is safety.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food, fuel, weather, and above all time planning are our tools to be safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed is safety.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather changes, gear fails, people fall ill. Uphill speed is our
friend. Slowness begets slowness. We need to be fast. 2000 vertical feet
(600 meters) gain per hour with a load (10-13kg) and a good track should
be possible when needed. We should be able to sustain 20 to 30 Alpine units (1km distance or 100m vertical) uphill per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gear must be optimized for our speed. Speed during travel, cooking, camping is key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundant systems are necessary.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundancy in navigation (altimeter and paper maps, compass and map, cell
phone, GPS), shelter (tent, poncho tarp, proper shovel for snow cave) and
sleeping systems (repair materials) is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social coherence trumps fun.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We stick together within reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest and recovery is very important.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to ensure we can handle a 14-day traverse in deep snow. Thorough
nightly rest is important to recover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light backcountry skis with kicker skins (e.g. skimo race skins) or scaled bases and climbing skins. Scaled bases are helpful for efficiency, but ice up. A normal pair of skis with kicker skins is a better option in my opinion.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am open to backcountry cross country skis for certain sections. But I
trust lightweight touring skis and can comfortably skate with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tent: Assuming shelter can be found in the forest, my &lt;b&gt;current&lt;/b&gt; choice: Seek Outside hot-tent and medium u-turn wood stove or Durston X-mid 2, fly only.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: I have tried digging a snow cave every night. It is too much work and too slow, but is a good backup shelter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If using a gas stove, a zipperless down sleeping bag (-20°F) and a synthetic overquilt. Timmermade gear serves me very well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If using a gas stove, a zipperless down sleeping bag (-20°F) and a synthetic overquilt. Timmermade gear serves me very well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If using a packable woodstove, zipperless down sleeping bag (-20°F) without overquilt.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: I have tried extending all the 3-season ultralight systems for winter and failed. This is my current trusted system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melt snow, heat water: gas stove for speed first, wood stove second. An
(additional) option is using a foldable Nalgene cantene between the back and
backpack (and combine no-cook with cold-soak). It is essential to plan in
water collection at flowing water.
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: I have tried the Trail Designs fissure alcohol systems for winter
traverses. They work well and are reliable, but are fidgety, slow, and stink too much to use in a tent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why no sled? Please read about my &lt;a href="./approach-and-style.html"&gt;approach to ski traverses&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Without the gear investments (about 8k$ upfront!), I would budget
at least 10k$. Weather-driven stays in town are a variable that may inflate that
number. I still need to research what permits will be necessary for certain sections.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Myself: Experienced alpine winter backcountry tour guide, splitboard and
ski mountaineer, powderhound, climate activist.  I am a climate scientist
turned firmware engineer, a little over 6' (184cm), 75kg, and injury-resistant
and well-conditioned. I was born in New Mexico, and live in Switzerland with
my wife.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have been out in the snow since I was little, but since 2012 every season
&amp;gt;80 days touring, with an upward trend.  For weight and efficiency reasons, I
learned how to ski recently, after 9 years of snowboarding and 9 years of
almost solely splitboarding. Skis just make more sense for traverses;
therefore, I ski, and I skied well enough for my traverse in Bulgaria, with
plenty of terrible snow, and I can ski well enough for this traverse of the
Continental Divide.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have never walked any of the long trails in summer. I plan to when I am older.
I have done multiple ski traverses in Switzerland and Bulgaria. I truly enjoy
being out in the wild, especially in winter. My favorite adventure is a ski
traverse. I enjoy 'bad' weather, also in winter. I view an attempt to walk the
CDT in winter, as a string of ski traverses.
&lt;/p&gt;

Tightly coupled to the mental capabilities, physical conditioning and the accompanying diet sets the fundament. Think years following the approach laid out in the book "Training for the Uphill Athlete".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once those two are clearly established, only then should one consider optimizing gear systems. Personal experience and online forums on the state-of-the-art prove helpful.

&lt;h4 id="orgd987f34"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.0.1.&lt;/span&gt; Ski setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lightweight alpine touring set: I used the Tecnica Zero G peak boot. They may not walk the best, but they are very stiff for their weight.
I used the SkiTrab Ortles 90 skis for winter and SkiTrab Maestro.2 skis for spring.  SkiTrab makes the simplest and most featured pin binding, while being light enough. I used the Gara and Vario.2 binding. I carry a binding remount kit, but have never needed it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org0ce12ae" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org0ce12ae"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.0.2.&lt;/span&gt; Sleeping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used the Timmermade Winter Wren -20⁰F with a GramXpert 50⁰F synthetic overbag for the coldest periods on a Therm-a-rest Xtherm. I shared a Spoonbill UL sleeping bag from Feathered Friends with a friend for the upper half of Montana's CD on an Exped double sleeping pad. Timmermade vapor barrier clothing helped me on cold nights.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgfa98920" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="orgfa98920"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.0.3.&lt;/span&gt; Tent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used the fly of a Durston X-mid 1 or, with my friend the Durston X-mid 2. I also used the Seek Outside Silex hot tent alone and the Seek Outside Guardian with my friend. Procuring wood and burning it to melt water was too slow, so we reverted bag to the white gas stove.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org37a1627" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org37a1627"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.0.4.&lt;/span&gt; Backpack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used the Superior Wilderness Designs Big Wild backpack. It carried well and, with the hanging hip belt, skied very well with a heavy load.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org06e8b54" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org06e8b54"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.0.5.&lt;/span&gt; Stove&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used the MSR XGK-EX with a modified Trail Designs Fissure windscreen-potstand combination to hold the MSR Big Titan pot. I burned bio-white gas. I also used a Seek Outside Medium U-Turn, which, when the temperatures regularly dipped below -20°F, made for comfortable but slow living.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org94753e6" class="outline-4"&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From inside out, top: SkiTrab Overglove Plus or Showa Temres 282 gloves, Patagonia Capilene Air hoody, Patagonia Houdini, Patagonia DAS light jacket, and, with significant precipitation and warm enough temperatures, the Zpacks Poncho Groundsheet, or, at camp a Timmermade SUL 1.5 down sweater.
From inside out, bottom: Pantyhose leggings, Mtntools Vapor Barrier Socks, 2 pair thin ski socks, boot-length thermal underwear, Montbell Dynamo wind pants, Patagonia DAS light pants.

&lt;p&gt;
Many backcountry areas are very remote, and more so during Winter. We need to be
able to take care of one another. That means having the WFR-certification. Swiss tour
guides only need a first aid course, oddly, but that is likely because medical
assistance here in Switzerland arrives 8-12 minutes(!) after being alerted, if
the weather allows.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-0-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We will see all snow types. We will may be tired and carry heavy packs. We will
need to be able to safely circumnavigate objective hazards. We need to ski at
an advanced level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-0-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Building a snow cave, choosing a safe campsite, having a dialed winter
sleeping system (down to about -30°C [-23°F]) are necessary skills.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id="org9cdcdfc"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.0.1.&lt;/span&gt; Avalanche Training&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guide groups in all avalanche conditions, adjusting to safe terrain,
dependent on the group's abilities. I would welcome a role-based group
structure, and can comfortably take the role for assessing avalanche danger. I
make mistakes, and the more eyes looking at the conditions, the lesser the
chance of missing signs of danger. If you are an experienced winter
backcountry ski tourer, you should also have avalanche training. With my
experience mentoring successful tour guide aspirants, I feel I can help you
apply your training, but you need the fundamentals and experience first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org44944c0" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org44944c0"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.0.2.&lt;/span&gt; Mental Strength Training&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Winter is cold, windy and snowy. I love it, but it still can get to
me. Getting my butt kicked is part of the adventure. I can center myself with
meditation. I can forgive harshness, moodiness, etc. and go back to being a
relaxed provider of bad jokes. Centering oneself is a skill. You need to
also have this ability when I inevitably forget to be thankful and
open. Mental resilience is key when we get our butts kicked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgf8a52b1" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="orgf8a52b1"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.0.3.&lt;/span&gt; Physical conditioning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-0-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need to be consistently fast. The risk of an overuse injury, overtraining,
or of a ski injury due to fatigue is high. Carrying a heavy pack through deep
snow is hard work. Furthermore, we need to be similarly fast. Social tension
due to differing fitness is a problem. We should complete one of the &lt;a href="https://uphillathlete.com"&gt;Uphill
Athlete&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://evokeendurance.com"&gt;Evoke Endurance&lt;/a&gt; courses &lt;b&gt;together&lt;/b&gt;, at the very least.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="org80cf37d"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's cold, and your skins aren't sticking to the base any more. Maybe you stored them in your jacket. Maybe your walked on sunny, but then shaded aspects. Maybe your skins partly loosened, for whatever reason, then accumulated snow, which transformed to ice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orge10c4c0" class="outline-2"&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's cold, and your skins aren't sticking to the base any more. Maybe you stored them in your jacket. Maybe your walked on sunny, but then shaded aspects. Maybe your skins partly loosened, for whatever reason, then accumulated snow, which transformed to ice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place one end of your ski down in the snow, lean the other on your
shoulder, with the base facing away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull the iced up sticky side of your skin over the exposed edges with a
fair bit of tension. The ice will scrape off and fall off. Also, this
roughens up the adhesive as well, so it adheres better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem fixed, at least for an hour or two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why does this work so well? The problem is usually not that the adhesive is
wet or cold. The problem is the layer of ice between your base and your
skins. Putting your skins in your coat only melts the ice or snow on
them. Some of this water then freezes onto the sticky surface when you reapply
your skins, causing or worsening the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="orga331617"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An tour guide apprentice of mine, Remo S., improved on my old method of using a knife blade
to scratch the ice off the sticky base of climbing skins.  "Necessity is the mother
of all inventions." His approach? He got sick of asking for my knife and used
his splitboard's edge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have written this book for those who helped me along the way, and for my
family and friends. I also write it for lovers of the wilderness, who do not
fear the feeling of insignificance but appreciate it. Some I may even inspire to
attempt some similarly epic ski traverse. Also, for those adventurers who like a
good story and appreciate an example of someone going ahead with their crazy
idea and succeeding, I write this book for you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The book will have prose interlaced with photos of people and remote places of
the US Rocky Mountains. I will do my absolute best to not disappoint you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Though very partial, my wife likes my writing style, and, while reading some of the
book, warns me that I won't be going on any such adventures anymore, or even
be leaving the house. I write the book for her as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I list a rough time plan for my northbound ski traverse along the

and have it reflected here, when possible.

Continental Divide of the western USA. I will attempt to update my progress

&lt;h2 id="org08db24e"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Route choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I aim to plan a route that will go 95% of the time given the likelihood that
the snowpack will be weak and instable. I rely on accurate slope angle
classes. I am routinely trying to optimize these routes to have better and
safer skiing. Of course, I am planning bail routes. If the bail routes aren't
there yet, they are either very obvious, or I haven't planned them yet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org35915a3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org35915a3"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Alpine units used here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I define an alpine unit as 1km horizontal distance or 100m vertical
ascent, which usually takes 15 minutes to travel. For the total units, for a
given distance, I count only the hard ones. That is, I count the distance and
the units uphill. This is a conservative approach; ideally the distances
traveled down, when skiing, are dreamy and easy. I calibrated these numbers
based on my past trips. I use these as a basis, even though I am in much
better shape, my kit is lighter, my skis are better, and my route planning
more exact. I expect these estimates to be accurate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Update 2023-01-16: &lt;b&gt;2 days behind&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Update 2023-02-15: &lt;b&gt;6 days behind, but postponing northern Wind River Traverse until early April, so two days behind until Canada, and 6 days behind Colorado restart date&lt;/b&gt;

Update 2023-05-01: &lt;b&gt;Starting the final Colorado section today&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I completed the first winter traversal of the Continental Divide of the
Continental USA from November 21st, 2022 to June 3rd, 2023. I started hiking on
the Continental Divide Trail from Crazy Cook Monument on November 21st, 2022, a
little after noon. I started skiing December 20th, north …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb78c8ee" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgb78c8ee"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I completed the first winter traversal of the Continental Divide of the
Continental USA from November 21st, 2022 to June 3rd, 2023. I started hiking on
the Continental Divide Trail from Crazy Cook Monument on November 21st, 2022, a
little after noon. I started skiing December 20th, north of Ghost Ranch, NM. I
reached the Canadian border on April 15th, around 13:30MST, with my partner
Lukas S.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was not yet done. I had postponed the heart of the Colorado Rockies and the
northern part of the Wind River Range until late spring, due to typically
unpredictable avalanche danger. First, I headed to the Winds, and afterwards
to Cumbres Pass, Colorado.  I finished at the Devil's Thumb Trailhead, near
Fraser, Colorado, on June 3rd, 2023, in the evening around 19:30MST.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That makes my endeavor 194 days long, with 25 days of hiking, about 123 days
of ski-touring, about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) traveled on skis. On an
average ski-touring day I walked 8-12 hours, covered 20-25km (12-15 miles)
distance, and climbed 1500-2000m (5000-6500ft) vertical.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I carried all of my food, shelter, and fuel for each section, in
self-supported in typical thru-hiker style.  In a typical week, I would walk 5
days, and rest 2 days. I ate about 1.1kg of food per day. At the beginning of
a typical 5-day ski traverse, my backpack would weigh about 13kg (30lbs).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I suffered no frostbite injuries, no major traumas, and was not caught in an
avalanche.  The coldest times were when I was in the southern Wind River Range
in late January 2023 and when an arctic front blew into the Centennial
Mountains in mid-February 2023. I do not know how cold it was. Some reports during the mid-February storm said -25°F (-30°C) with winds of 30mph (50kmh). It was cold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An epic ski traverse it was. But just as epic was the winter for much of the
Rocky Mountain West! The winter of 2022-2023, a transition season from La Niña
to El Niño, was one of the snowiest and coldest on record for most of the
Rocky Mountain West. I was thankful that I had plenty of snow to ski on, but
getting snowed on often and skinning through fresh snow slowed me considerably.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I skied a lot of powder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb32a139" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgb32a139"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Route choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although inspired by the Continental Divide Trail (CDT), I deviated often from
the CDT to optimize safety, travel speed, and fun. Downhill skiing the CDT is
not much fun. Unless there are otherwise too many fallen trees or other
vegetation, I took the direct line. In a few cases, I also took snowmobile
trails for faster travel and, sometimes, better scenery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org07c90eb" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org07c90eb"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Verification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used the Garmin Inreach Messenger. It worked satisfactorily and the
integration with my Garmin Instinct Solar 2 and the Garmin Messenger Android app
was not excellent, but satisfactory. The Garmin Inreach Messenger does not
record tracks, but merely sends a tracking point to Garmin's satellites at a
preset (10-minute) interval. These 10-minute tracking points are all I have for
formal verification.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For proof, my Garmin Mapshare page is: &lt;a href="https://share.garmin.com/skitraverse"&gt;https://share.garmin.com/skitraverse&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But CalTopo provides better mapping tools, in my experience. Look:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;"&gt;
 &lt;iframe src="https://caltopo.com/m/E0UE6"

            marginheight="0"

            height="600"
            style="max-width: 810px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;"&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going over a mountain versus maintaining elevation and traversing around usually requires the same amount of effort. I rerouted often, but also skipped portions entirely.  
Due to avalanche danger, my unwillingness to walk on the side of a road, my unwillingness to walk a wind-scoured ridge to a pass as opposed to skiing off the ridge, or my need to make a up time, I skipped some of the parts typically considered part of the CDT. I list them in chronological order.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Road walk, US-180, turn off to Silver City&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 22 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Road walk, County road A083, north of Pie Town&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 20 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Road walk, Zuni Canyon Road, south of Grants&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 8 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Road walk, NM 197, south of Cuba&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 4 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Road walk, CO 14 and US 40 to Rabbit Ears Pass&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 17 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Road walk, WY HWY 71&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 22 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ridge walk, east of North Fork, ID&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 60 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skiing, northern part of the Pintlars&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 64 units of good skiing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skiing, Anaconda Cutoff&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 207 units of skiing around Butte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail walk, US 2&lt;/b&gt;: I skipped about 30 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An overview can be found at &lt;a href="https://caltopo.com/m/E0UE6"&gt;https://caltopo.com/m/E0UE6&lt;/a&gt;, which contains an import of my GPS-tracks from the Garmin Explore website (blue), and routes of the portions that I skipped (purple).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are many reasons people have at most attempted only parts of the CDT in wintertime, the most common reason being personal safety. I am the first person to attempt to traverse the entire CDT in wintertime. My example sets the tone for future attempts. Accordingly, in Alpine style, I rerouted almost every day, and postponed critical sections.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
