<h1>Expedition style</h1>
<p>Let me establish two approaches to a ski traverses longer than a week,
as I understand them. The classical approach is similar to a polar
expedition. This expedition style entails harnessing a heavy (&gt;1kg)
sled that cannot be practically carried, taking a lot of liquid fuel, a
smaller pack, and making an average progress each day of 8-40km, summing
up and down. Ski tours are loops starting at basecamp when the time is
right. Passable terrain is limited by the skill to handle the heavy
sled, but is practically limited to mellow terrain with few obstacles.
The range of total distances covered can be very high (1000km), strongly
depending on conditions. Weight is always an issue but there's a sled.
This approach is great for long-lived basecamps in remote places.</p>
<h1>Alpine style</h1>
<p>I will focus here on the application of alpinism's 'light and fast'
style to ski traverses. I'll call them alpine style ski traverses. The
key difference between expedition style and alpine style is speed.
Alpine style assumes speedy sustained progress, typically twice as fast
as expedition style. The choices of gear are important, as weight
heavily influences speed. Training requires a solid aerobic base, upon
which a lot of training with a heavy pack can be done in the off season.</p>
<p>Alpine style ski traverses entail carrying everthing in a large, yet
light and compressible backpack, possibly with a small (&lt;1kg)
packable sled (e.g. a boggy, see
<a href="http://www.johnbaldwin.ca/trip-planning-toboggan.asp">http://www.johnbaldwin.ca/trip-planning-toboggan.asp</a>) when starting.
Average progress each day can vary wildly from 10km to 50km per day,
summing up and down. Passable terrain is limited by each group member's
ability to ski with a loaded pack. The range of distances to be covered
are moderate to high (100 to 500km) between resupplies, are limited by
the speed of the group and their ability to carry the sustaining food
and fuel, and, of course, are strongly dependent on conditions. Weight
is a core issue.</p>
<p>The alpine style allows access to the much steeper terrain. Thinking of
forward progress in distance is not useful. I'll define an 'alpine unit'
based on the military approximation, but is taught in certain German
circles as a Leistungskilometer (effort kilometer). I was taught the
same concept but the word Einheit (unit) was used.</p>
<p>The concept of an alpine unit hinges on the assumption that one
kilometer of distance requires the same amount of effort and time as a
hundred meters of altitude gain. <strong>The alpine unit equates 100m vertical
gain with 1000m distance.</strong> A handy calculation for imperial units is
difficult on the fly, so roughly convert vertical feet to meters. Also,
overlaying the UTM grid (1km by 1km) on a map allows for relatively
precise determination of distance, without the aid of digital
technology. A good first approximation for the time necessary for an
alpine unit is 15 minutes or 4 units per hour. Although individuals may
be much much faster, the time taken for a unit must be constantly
observed and used for planning forward progress both in the short and
long terms. Note, an old and wise mountain guide says that this equation
needs modification when the terrain is very flat (&lt;5°) or very steep
(&gt;35°). When it is flat, only consider the distance, when it is
steep, only consider the height.</p>
<p>The number of alpine units sustained per day over the course of a week
is an important result of reflection when planning the next ski
traverse. A first approximation of this sustained progress could be half
of the normal alpine units done on a day's ski tour. If you are strong
with a heavy pack, take 3/4 of the speed on a day's ski tour.</p>
<p>Alpine style ski traverses allow for continuous replanning of the route,
fast exits, avoidance or mitigation of bad weather, and, my favorite,
complete immersion in a mountain range. This is the approach of the
pioneers of ski traverses, light and therefore fast and nimble. Bill
Briggs did not have a sled on the Bugaboo to Rogers Traverse. With the
constantly improving lightweight gear, improving map material, denser
weather observation networks, improved remote sensing data availability
and access, this practice can become safer and more enjoyable with time,
especially when experience allows you to whittle down your kit, and you
condition yourself further.</p>
<h1>My alpine style ski traverses</h1>
<p>In my case, my pack can weigh a maximum of about 25kg, including skis,
and I am still having fun. I aim for 40 units per day, which assumes
some poor conditions and some good conditions for progress. My daily
progress on my last traverse in Bulgaria averaged at about alpine 45
units per day sustained over 8 days, including a rest day. That's not
fast, but it suffices to cover considerable ground (360 alpine units
total). I used 106mm wide skis and freeride bindings. I could have been
faster with narrower skis, lighter bindings, or scale-based skis. I have
much room to learn and improve.</p>
<p>I am thankful for the concise book on winter mountaineering 'Bergsport
Winter' in German. I am most thankful for all my mentor's and friend's
guidance and patience. They were pivotal in aiding me to develop the
necessary skills of determining avalanche risk, orienteering in all
conditions, detailed map study and route planning, as well as little
bits of information to make prolonged stays in the often harsh winter
landscape enjoyable. They continue to be very helpful and good company.
Thank you!</p>
