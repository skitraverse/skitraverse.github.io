<p>The following answers reflect my experience. I iterate and change my
systems and approaches constantly. I have changed alot of ideas in the
past and expect to change more. Continued learning is one of my core
axioms. Please remember this when you encounter my strong opinions. I
experience glee when I have been proven wrong. Make me happy; convince
me otherwise, please.</p>
<h1>This is an extremely dangerous undertaking. Are you crazy?</h1>
<p>A wintertime traverse of the CDT could be very dangerous. I am not very
risk-tolerant. With all the tools I have, I can plan out most of the
risk. Furthermore, being in the snow every day gives me insight that I
may not get from an avalanche risk forecast.</p>
<p>The mountains will tell me when to stop.</p>
<p>There indeed are some objectively dangerous sections in Colorado, when
the snowpack is weak, which it usually is. I am not loyal to a
snow-covered CDT footpath. I will optimize for safety and fun, taking
the route that makes sense given the conditions. I will pass through
this area when the avalanche risk is predictable.</p>
<p>Ski traverses are my thing. I am past the phase of needing to prove
something to someone. This idea has gripped me. I will pursue it until
it is indeed crazy. Then I will wait and try again. Everytime I study a
map, the slope angle classes, the distances, study my last trip, I feel
good. There are usually decent exit options, alternate routes, and
always the option of turning back. I got this.</p>
<p>I say this undertaking is ambitious.</p>
<p>"We don’t see things as they are; we see them as we are." - Anonymous</p>
<h1>Do I have to also take scale-based skis?</h1>
<p>Edit: no, not anymore. The Red Desert and the Ghost Ranch to Cumbres
Pass sections are done. Now, you should have a pair of downhill touring
skis with SkiTrab bindings, and two pairs of skins, a pair of race or
kicker skins, and a normal pair of skins. If you are versed with kicker
wax, I am open to that or something similar.</p>
<p>We will have some flat sections and lots of sections of rolling terrain.
Scale-based skis are the most optimal choice for such travel. The
downhill disadvantage is partially compensated by the reduced need to
use climbing skins. You glide better when walking, your skis weigh less
without skins, far fewer transitions are necessary, and you make a cool
buzzing sound when you descend! What's not to love about that? That is,
if you can descend. Iced scales are a reality and they definitely take
some of the fun out of ski touring.</p>
<p>Above all, we need to be on the same page. Scale-based skis are the an
optimal tool for this endeavor as a whole. That is, unless you are a
skimo racer who plans to come with race skis and you can ski them in 3
feet of powder or facets safely, and comfortably transition in under a
minute, every 10 minutes, with a heavy pack, and are sure that this
won't frustrate you. Otherwise, yes, you should seriously consider
scale-based skis. They make narrower ones, and they make fatter ones.</p>
<p>My current system is to take a second pair of narrow skins (e.g. 3cm
wide). I use skimo race skins for the less steep parts. I fully
recommend this system.</p>
<p>We both need to be open to ideas for optimizing forward progress. Above
all, we need to be on the same page. Convince me otherwise and I will
thank you.</p>
<h1>How well should I be able to ski?</h1>
<p>You should be a pretty good skier. If skiing powder is a challenge, it
will be even harder with a heavy pack pulling you into the back seat.
Skiing breakable crust without proper skill with a heavy pack is injury
prone and thus dangerous. Above all, you should be able to ski safely,
even if that is not stylish.</p>
<h1>Why not use cross-country skis?</h1>
<p>That may be a good idea. I guess the gear and capabilities of
scale-based, touring skis is just more advanced, that is, lightweight
and durable. Also, the terrain we will be traveling through is too steep
for cross-country gear (and my abilities with cross country skis). If
it's an awesome powder day and we are impeded by avalanche danger, I
would probably want to go ride some powder. I don't have any experience
with backcountry cross-country skis, and consider them to be too
specialized for this undertaking. If you wish to join for a flat section
and are comfortable waiting on me for certain areas, then yes, bring
backcountry cross-country skis.</p>
<h1>I'm taking my splitboard, ok?</h1>
<p>Comrade, I feel your love for surfing the great white wave. I wish I was
still on a splitboard. It's too inefficient, in my experience. Even with
a split-tech system, the lightest scale-based board (yes, that's a
thing), and world-class condition, you'll probably be too great of a
drag and run the risk of overexertion. What's more important to you?</p>
<p>I was a splitboarder. People on skis were keeping up with me, who should
not have been able to. The efficiency hit is big. I learned to ski
because of that. Long traverses and total immersion in mountains were
more important to me than the ultimate fun on the downhill. On a
traverse, the sum of type I-fun is greater with skis. Furthermore, the
sum of type II-fun is less with skis.</p>
<p>A splitboard is less efficient and heavier. The less efficient you are,
the more food you have to eat, the more food and fuel you have to take,
the heavier your pack, the slower you are, the less efficient you are…</p>
<p>Convince me that you've got what it takes to make it fun and safe.</p>
<h1>What if the mother of all storms broadsides us?</h1>
<p>We will track weather. Say if we were somehow impeded, and had to hunker
down, we would dig into the snow. In a snowcave, we can regulate the
temperature very well. We will almost always plan on taking 10-20%
longer than planned.</p>
<p>Simpler snow caves (torpedo or coffin style) used to be my preferred
shelter, by the way. On a long traverse, it is too much work to be
sustainable.</p>
<p>If it's obvious that we will be impeded, we could exit to the nearest
town to wait for conditions to settle. We could also adjust our route to
avoid risky situations, and still hopefully be able to ski the trees. In
total, I plan an extra 30 to 45 days 'waiting' for safe conditions.</p>
<h1>How do we handle emergency situations?</h1>
<p>We don't get into such situations in the first place. We need to have
enough conditioning and skill that we are well within our limits so that
we can comfortably handle expected and unexpected situations.</p>
<p>Should bad luck happen, our skill must suffice to stabilize the
situation and hunker down or exit.</p>
<p>Avalanche: We must not get into an avalanche. We will carry avalanche
gear, have training, dig pits, cut cornices, and require visibility when
heading into avalanche terrain.</p>
<p>Gear failure: We fix it to the best of our abilities. We plan on poles
breaking, bindings ripping out, sleeping pads popping, and bring repair
materials.</p>
<p>Social failure: If we're a pair or a triplet, we stick together, until
reasonable departure is reached i.e. a town or someone with
transportation means.</p>
<p>Injury: There is a huge body of literature and many courses available.
The WFR course should suffice; take one or refresh. We'll figure things
out given the situation. We prepare ourselves to not sustain an injury,
and handle a situation if the worst happens.</p>
<h1>Why not use a reliable alcohol stove?</h1>
<p>I tried my best with the Trail Designs Ti-Tri System. It works and is
very dependable, at altitude and in the cold. It's awesome. And
canisters are a pain in the neck.</p>
<p>But the pinnacle of Trail Designs work is fiddly, slow, and stinks like
hell. In the end, it is also heavier. For a 10-day ski traverse, I need
1.2 liters of ethanol, plus the 400g kit (Toaks 1.3L pot). That will
total around 1.4kg. If I take an inverted canister stove with a
windscreen (110g) with a 1l pot (190g), with a 450g gas canister (650g),
I get better performance at a lower weight (950g). Taking a lighter
liquid fuel stove with a windscreen (410g), a 1l pot (190g), and 800ml
of fuel (~850g with bottle), the weight is about like alcohol at 1.45kg,
with better performance.</p>
<p>But this relationship tips even more in favor of the 'standard' winter
systems, if I have a partner. Because the inverted canister or liquid
fuel stove is so fast to melt snow, my partners only need to carry their
gas. The Ti-Tri would require each partner to carry their own system to
melt snow within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>The two-person total starting weight for 10-days tallies the Ti-Tri at
about 3.2kg and the inverted canister or liquid fuel systems at about
1.6kg (with two stoves) or 2.2kg, respectively.</p>
<p>The ending weight after 10 days of awesomeness? The alcohol setup is
lighter. One-person end weight of the Tri-tri: 450g, canister setup is
500g, liquid fuel setup 640; two-person end weight, Ti-Tri: 900g,
canister: 785 (two stoves), liquid fuel: 800. If we have three people?
The liquid fuel is lightest is lighter (Ti-Tri 1350g, canister 985g,
liquid fuel: 850).</p>
<p>But at the end of the awesome 10-day traverse, our packs are empty. All
the time and frustration saved is sweetened even more by a lack of or a
minimal weight penalty, even if I'm alone. The time saved, the starting
weight advantage, when everything is heavier, the ability to comfortably
and quickly melt snow in a cabin, tent, or snow cave make this an easy
decision to take an inverted canister stove or liquid fuel for winter
outings.</p>
<p>If we're sure we have continued access to water why not go no-cook? But
if we're melting snow, the standard approach is my suggestion.</p>
<h1>How do we resupply?</h1>
<p>We use the normal Post Offices that help out thru-hikers in summertime.
Some are closed in winter, so we need to plan around that. Also, we have
a lot of really nice, selfless people support us with food and fuel
caches, or we cache things ourselves. And we send them thanks and best
wishes and cards and chocolates etc. We may consider caches for certain
remote sections in Montana and Wyoming.</p>
<h1>In how good of physical condition should I be?</h1>
<p>There are two aspects to this. First is the obvious need to be
aerobically well-conditioned i.e. hike all day every day for months.
Considerable strength is also necessary to deal with the weight of the
heavier pack. You should be very injury-resistant. The book 'Training
for the Uphill Athlete' is our training manual.</p>
<h1>What about mental strength?</h1>
<p>You should be in good mental shape. Impediments, harsh weather, deep
snow, edgy partners and fatigue are all part of the game. They gnaw at
your mental strength. They can pull you off center. They can
disproportionately subtract from the immense beauty and serenity of the
winter landscape. If you snap, you are in a harsh environment with many
objective dangers without your wits. If you are not skilled at centering
yourself, at righting your keeling ship, this endeavor will not be fun
and may be very dangerous.</p>
<p>We all have our techniques. Ego is a weakness. I recommend Vipassana
meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka.</p>
<h1>Why should I trust you?</h1>
<p>You shouldn't. Trust is earned not given. I expect you to ask lots of
questions, poke holes in my plans and approaches, and show me where I am
wrong. I would be incredibly thankful.</p>
<p>There are few people that have the skill and mindset to safely attempt a
winter traverse of the Continental Divide. Considerable vetting is
necessary to make sure that our values and goals align.</p>
<h1>What's your background?</h1>
<p>I volunteer for the Swiss Alpine Club. I have attained the certification
of Tourenleiter II. This means that I can guide ski tours on glaciers
and alpine terrain. The necessary skills include avalanche risk
assessment, orienteering, first aid, group management, crevasse
(self-)rescue and taking guests on a short rope.</p>
<p>In contrast to the US system, the Swiss touring culture is quite open
and common. Tour guiding is mostly volunteer and is very prevalent.
Switzerland boasts more than 1,000 mountain guides. The relatively few
that decide to become a full-fledged mountain guides are the
professionals that administer the tour guide courses that I have
attended.</p>
<p>I have considered mountain guide certification. After voicing this
consideration, all of my older Swiss mountain guide friends ask me,
"Why?!"</p>
<p>It is true; I have apprehension to make my passion a day job. Financing
those adventures would become more challenging, if I were to do it
professionally. I would improve my skills and may have an easier time
finding colleagues for my adventures.</p>
<p>I am still considering. Check out <a href="../../info/my-story">an abbreviated
list</a>, for more.</p>
