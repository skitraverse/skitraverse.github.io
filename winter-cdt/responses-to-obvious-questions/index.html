<h1>How do we handle emergency situations?</h1>
<p>That depends on what happens, and where it happens. If we can't exit
immediately, we hunker down in a forest, build a fire, build a snow
cave, and snuggle until we can get moving out again or are extracted. We
alert and request with a cell phone or satellite transceiver. We need to
do everything possible do avoid an emergency situation. I consider being
in an emergency to be a mistake.</p>
<p>Avalanche: This will likely to result in an injury and lost gear. We
exit prematurely, and thank our lucky stars. We're unlucky and/or
ignorant if this happens. We plan on actively minimizing ignorance as we
move.</p>
<p>Gear failure: We fix it to the best of our abilities and exit if it's
critical and irrepairable (MSR Reactor overheats, binding rips out,
sleeping bag/pad explodes).</p>
<p>Social failure: If we're a pair or a triplet, we stick together no
matter what, until reasonable departure is reached i.e. a town or
someone with transportation means. We exit prematurely. If we have a
group of 4 or more? If both parties are self-sufficient (stove, shelter,
navigational material), a departure in the backcountry is reasonable.</p>
<p>Injury: There is a huge body of literature and many courses available.
Take two courses. We'll figure things out given the situation. We
prepare ourselves to be able to help.</p>
<h1>Why not use a reliable alcohol stove?</h1>
<p>I tried my best with the Trail Designs Ti-Tri System. It works and is
very dependable, at altitude and in the cold. It's awesome. And
canisters are a pain in the neck.</p>
<p>But the pinnacle of Trail Designs work is fiddly, slow, and stinks like
hell. In the end, it is also heavier. For a 10-day ski traverse, I need
1.2 liters of ethanol, plus the 400g kit (Toaks 1.3L pot). That will
total around 1.6kg. If I take the MSR reactor (490g), with a 450g gas
canister (650g), and the MSR DeepDish bowl (60g) to warm the canister
with water, I get better performance at a lower weight (1.2kg).</p>
<p>But this relationship tips even more in favor of the Reactor, if I have
a partner. Because the Reactor is so fast and with the 1.7L pot size, my
partners only need to carry their gas. The ti-tri would require each
partner to carry their own system to melt snow within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>The two-person total starting weight comparison tallies Ti-Tri at about
3.2kg and MSR Reactor system at about 2kg.</p>
<p>The ending weight after 10 days of awesomeness? The alcohol setup is
lighter. One-person end weight of the Tri-tri: 400g, MSR Reactor 750g;
two-person end weight, Ti-Tri: 800g, MSR Reactor 950. If we have three
people? We break even (Ti-Tri 1200g, Reactor 1150g).</p>
<p>But at the end of the awesome 10-day traverse, our packs are empty. All
the time and frustration saved justifies the minimal end weight penalty,
even if I'm alone. The time saved, the starting weight advantage, when
everything is heavier, the ability to comfortably cook in a cabin, tent,
or snow cave make this an easy decision to take the MSR Reactor for
winter outings.</p>
<p>If we're sure we have continued access to water the ti-tri wins out, if
we're melting snow, the MSR Reactor is my choice.</p>
<h1>How do we resupply?</h1>
<p>We have a lot of really nice, selfless people support us with food and
fuel caches. And we send them thanks and best wishes and cards and
chocolates etc. We may consider caches for certain remote sections in
Montana and Wyoming.</p>
<h1>This is an extremely dangerous undertaking. Are you crazy?</h1>
<p>The wintertime traverse of the CDT could be very dangerous. The mountain
will tell me when to stop. To be able to hear that I have to listen to
the mountain, and not to those who say it's not possible to traverse the
CDT safely in wintertime.</p>
<p>There indeed are some objectively dangerous sections in Colorado, when
the snowpack is weak, which it usually is. I am not loyal to a
snow-covered CDT footpath. I will optimize for safety and fun, taking
the route that makes sense given the conditions.</p>
<p>Ski traverses are my thing. I am past the phase of needing to prove
something to someone. This idea has gripped me. I will pursue it until
it is indeed crazy. Then I will wait and try again. Everytime I study a
map, the slope angle classes, the distances, I feel good. There are
usually decent exit options, alternate routes, and always the option of
turning back. I got this.</p>
<h1>Do I have to also take scale-based skis?</h1>
<p>I think you'd be crazy to take anything else. The minimal downhill
disadvantage is more than made up for by the reduced need to use
climbing skins. You glide better when walking, your skis weigh less
without skins, far fewer transitions are necessary, you can take much
narrower and thus lighter skins, and you make a cool buzzing sound when
you descend! What's not to love about that?</p>
<p>Above all, we need to be on the same page. Scale-based skis are the most
optimal tool for this endeavor. That is, unless you are a skimo racer
who plans to come with toothpicks and you can ski them in 3 feet of
powder or facets safely, and comfortably transition in under a minute,
every 10 minutes, with a heavy pack, and are sure that this won't
frustrate you. Otherwise, yes, you also need to take scale-based skis.
They also make narrower ones.</p>
<h1>How well should I be able to ski?</h1>
<p>You should be a pretty good skier. If skiing powder is a challenge, it
will be even harder with a heavy pack pulling you into the back seat.
Skiing breakable crust without proper skill with a heavy pack is injury
prone and thus dangerous. Above all, you should be able to ski safely,
even if that is not stylish.</p>
<h1>What if the mother of all storms broadsides us?</h1>
<p>We will track weather. Say if we were somehow impeded, and had to hunker
down, we would dig into the snow. In a snowcave, we can regulate the
temperature very well.</p>
<p>This used to be my preferred shelter, by the way. On a long traverse, it
is too much work to be sustainable.</p>
<h1>Why not use cross-country skis?</h1>
<p>That may be a good idea. I guess the gear and capabilities of
scale-based, touring skis is just more advanced, that is, lightweight
and durable. Also, the terrain we will be traveling through is too steep
for cross-country gear (and my abilities). If it's an awesome powder day
and we are impeded by avalanche danger, I would probably want to go ride
some powder.</p>
<h1>I'm taking my splitboard, ok?</h1>
<p>No. It's too inefficient, in my experience. Even with a split-tech
system, the lightest scale-based board, and world-class condition,
you'll be too great of a drag.</p>
<p>I was a splitboarder. People on skis were keeping up with me, who should
not have been able to. The efficiency hit is big. I learned to ski
because of that. Long ski traverses were more important to me than the
ultimate fun on the downhill. On a traverse, the sum of type I-fun is
greater with skis. Furthermore, the sum of type II-fun is less with
skis.</p>
<p>The less efficient you are, the more food you have to eat, the more food
and fuel you have to take, the heavier your pack, the slower you are,
the less efficient you are…</p>
<h1>In how good of physical condition should I be?</h1>
<p>There are two aspects to this. First is the obvious need to be
aerobically well-conditioned i.e. hike all day every day for months.
Considerable strength is also necessary to deal with the weight of the
heavier pack. You should be very injury-resistant. The book 'Training
for the Uphill Athlete' is our training manual.</p>
<h1>What about mental strength?</h1>
<p>You should be in good mental shape. Impediments, harsh weather, deep
snow, edgy partners and fatigue are all part of the game. They gnaw at
your mental strength. They can pull you off center. They can
disproportionately subtract from the immense beauty and serenity of the
winter landscape. If you snap, you are in a harsh environment with many
objective dangers without your wits. If you are not skilled at centering
yourself, at righting your keeling ship, this endeavor will not be fun
and may be very dangerous.</p>
<p>We all have our techniques. Additionally, I strongly recommend Vipassana
meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka. Ego is a weakness.</p>
