<h1>Timing</h1>
<p>Of all things, the timing and sequence is where flexibility will be
necessary.</p>
<p>Currently, I see two options, and list them in order of my preference. I
would start northbound mid-November, most likely exiting at Cumbres
Pass, Colorado, but possibly continuing northward until the avalanche
conditions become too unpredictable. Another less preferable option, but
possibly the only reasonable option for a continuous footpath border to
border, would be to start southbound sometime in January or February,
with the goal of being in Grand Lake, Colorado by mid-April.</p>
<p>Why the two options? The technical crux of wintertime CDT is the
combination of steep terrain of central and southern Colorado and
notoriously weak snowpack. This area is reserved for the late
springtime. Past Grand Lake and the Front Range, the CDT begins to
mellow, and the snowpack thickens.</p>
<p>Why is southbound starting mid-Winter my second preference? In general,
it is better to walk up warm, crusty, and usually more stable southern
faces in the sun, and ski quickly through colder, softer northerly
aspects, where weak layers lurk and safety distances are easily
maintained. Thus, the disadvantages would be missing a considerable
amount of powder, hiking in the coldest temps on the mountain (only bad
when it's frigid), hiking on the most dangerous aspects of the mountain
(increasing the time of exposure to risk), being less able to use a
solar charger, possibly hiking up with crampons and skis on my back and
having to walk down the barren southern slope, and, finally, being in
New Mexico in June, a hot and windy place at that time of year. None of
those are deal breakers. Also, after approximately 2.5 months, mid-April
or early May, I'd be in central Colorado, approximately, which is the
time to head through the most technical portion of the wintertime CDT.</p>
<p>Probably most importantly, I don't have a partner yet. The three weeks
until we may hit considerable snow in New Mexico and switch to skis will
serve as an extended trail date for anyone who chooses to join me. We
will work out our routines and quirks by Christmas, I expect. Also, on
the New Mexican portion, we can get our legs and backs ready for the
more strenuous but fun skiing portion.</p>
<h1>Path and Terrain</h1>
<p>The terrain along the CDT is typically mellow, avoiding the common ski
objectives which are often a short distance away. I plan on deviating
from the 'classical' CDT path to avoid avalanche risks and to chase good
snow. This will depend also on my partners.</p>
<p>For example, the CDT path through the Wind River range could not be more
gentle given the surrounding terrain. I guess that by the time we get
there, we may be itching for a more ambitious path, although I doubt
that. We'll see then and there what makes sense.</p>
<p>Above all, I am not loyal to a snow-covered footpath. We must optimize
according to the following principles.</p>
<h1>Principles</h1>
<ol>
<li>Safety first.<ul>
<li>If we need to wait out a storm cycle, we ride powder or rest
    until the snow settles. I carry a helmet, ice axe, beacon,
    probe, proper shovel, ski goggles, satellite transceiver, etc.
    Safety first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proper planning is safety.<ul>
<li>Food, fuel, weather, and above all time planning are our tools
    to be safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speed is safety.<ul>
<li>Weather changes, gear fails, people fall ill. Uphill speed is
    our friend. Slowness begets slowness. We need to be fast. 2000
    vertical feet (600 meters) gain per hour with a load (10-13kg)
    and a good track should be possible when needed. We should be
    able to sustain 20 to 30 Alpine units (1km distance or 100m
    vertical) uphill per day.</li>
<li>Gear must be optimized for our speed. Speed during travel,
    cooking, camping is key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redundant systems are necessary.<ul>
<li>Redundancy in navigation (altimeter and paper maps, compass and
    map, cell phone, GPS), shelter (tent, poncho tarp, proper shovel
    for snowcave) and sleeping systems (repair materials) is
    necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social coherence trumps fun.<ul>
<li>We stick together within reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rest and recovery is very important.<ul>
<li>We need to ensure we can handle a 14-day traverse in deep snow.
    Thorough nightly rest is important to recover.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Systems</h1>
<ul>
<li>Light backcountry skis with kicker skins (e.g. skimo race skins) or
    scaled bases and climbing skins. Scaled bases are helpful for
    efficiency, but ice up. A normal pair of skis with kicker skins is a
    better option in my opinion.<ul>
<li>I am open to backcountry cross country skis for certain
    sections. But I trust lightweight touring skis and can
    comfortably skate with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tent: My <strong>current</strong> choice: Seek Outside Silex and medium u-turn
    wood stove, Candidates: Seek Outside Cimarron or Redcliff, Durston
    X-mid 2 with solid inner tent, HMG UltaMid 4, Tarptent Stratospire
    Li with solid inner.<ul>
<li>Note: I have tried digging a snow cave every night. It is too
    much work and too slow, but is a good backup shelter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zipperless down sleeping bag (-20Â°F) and, if using the XGK-EX, DCF
    vapor barrier clothing and overquilt. Timmermade gear serves me very
    well.<ul>
<li>Note: I have tried extending all the 3-season ultralight systems
    for winter and failed. This is my current trusted system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Melt snow, heat water: wood stove first, MSR XGK-EX second. An
    (additional) option is using a foldable Nalgene cantene between the
    back and backpack (and combine no-cook with cold-soak). It is
    essential to plan in water collection at flowing water. Otherwise,
    we'll carry too much fuel.<ul>
<li>Note: I have tried the Trail Designs fissure alcohol systems for
    winter traverses. They work well and are reliable, but are
    fidgety, slow, and stink too much to use in a tent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

traverses</a>.</p>
<h1>Finances</h1>
<p>Without the gear investments (about 8k$ upfront!), I would budget at
least 10k$. Weather-driven stays in town are a variable that may inflate
that number. I still need to research what permits will be necessary for
certain sections.</p>
<h1>People</h1>
<p>Myself: Experienced alpine winter backcountry tour guide, splitboard and
ski mountaineer, powderhound, climate activist. I am 37 years old, a
climate scientist turned firmware engineer, a little over 6' (184cm),
75kg, and injury-resistant and well-conditioned. I was born in New
Mexico, and live in Switzerland with my wife, with no kids.</p>
<p>I have been out in the snow since I was little, but since 2012 every
season &gt;80 days touring, with an upward trend. For weight and
efficiency reasons, I learned how to ski recently, after 9 years of
snowboarding and 9 years of almost solely splitboarding. Skis just make
more sense for traverses; therefore, I ski, and I skied well enough for
my traverse in Bulgaria, with plenty of terrible snow, and I can ski
well enough for this traverse of the Continental Divide.</p>
<p>I have never walked any of the long trails. I plan to when I am older. I
have done multiple ski traverses in Switzerland and Bulgaria. I truly
enjoy being out in the wild, especially in winter. My favorite thing to
do is a ski traverse. I enjoy 'bad' weather, also in winter. I view an
attempt to walk the CDT in winter mostly as a string of ski traverses.</p>
<p>Lukas S.: Experienced ski mountaineer, firmware engineer, long-time tour
partner of Brian, living in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p>You: Experienced winter backcountry <strong>ski</strong> tourer. You should be
passionate about winter, cold-resistant, have a positive outlook and be
full of energy. Also, I am open to partial companionship. If you have
the skills, with some vetting you are welcome to joing me for certain
parts, although I am wary of the social aspect. The mental toll of
winter conditions tests me every time, but I can handle it and still
have fun. Can you still have fun when Old Man Winter tests you?</p>
<h1>Fundraiser</h1>
<p>This undertaking is very egotistical of me, but will help me grow at the
same time. I sure would like to take the opportunity set a fundraiser
challenge and have people join me in donating money to a cause. My best
idea yet is to fund an organization the supports less fortunate
communities to build out their renewable energy mix, with the goal of
long-term energy autonomy. I am open to ideas. I guess I'd donate a
dollar per mile progress.</p>
<h1>Interested in joining me?</h1>
<p>I will only traverse the Continental Divide in winter if I have a
partner for the more critical sections. If you are interested, please
read about my <a href="../on-style-and-approach">approach to ski traverses</a>,
please read through <a href="../skills-and-training">skills and abilities for this
attempt</a>, and take time to reflect and decide.
Let's talk.</p>
