<h1>Plan</h1>
<p>Sometime between November 15th and December 1st until Christmas, I plan
to walk north from the Mexican border. I plan to stop on December 23rd
to go spend Christmas with family. During these down days, we need to
decide whether we will continue northward, skip ahead and come back
either from where we stopped for Christmas or north of whereever it
makes sense. I would like to start gently, to make sure that Christmas
time is enough recovery for the next steps.</p>
<p>Why start in the South and why skip around? I have four reasons. First,
I will not walk through sketchy avalanche conditions. Persistent weak
layers are very common for a Colorado snowpack. Southern and central
Colorado tend to have a stable snowpack sometime in March or April.
Faceted weak layers are to be taken dead seriously. Walking in the hot
New Mexican sun in May doesn't sound very appealing either. Very likely,
I wouldn't be able to ski much in May, anyways.</p>
<p>Second, I don't want to be dealing with hungry, emaciated critters,
possibly with young, in Montana (especially Glacier NP) or Wyoming
(Yellowstone NP) in April or May. I would rather deal with the heavy
snowfalls in January (average 20 days of snowfall) and enjoy the powder
while waiting for the snow to settle! This problem is overstated. Bears
and wolves usually mind their business. Habituated, problematic animals
are usually caused by careless humans. It is something to keep in mind.
Startling a bear while skiing down or up is possibly a dangerous
situation.</p>
<p>Third, it is better to walk up warm, crusty, and usually more stable
southern faces in the sun, and ski quickly through colder, softer
northerly aspects, where weak layers lurk and safety distances are
easily maintained.</p>
<p>Fourth, and probably most importantly, I don't have a partner yet. The
five weeks leading up to Christmas will serve as an extended trail date
for anyone who chooses to join me. We will work out our routines and
quirks by Christmas, I hope. Also, on the New Mexican portion, we can
get our legs and backs ready for the fun skiing part up north.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the snowpacks in Colorado look inviting, we will keep
heading North. Walking up in the Sun and skiing down the soft north
faces is the most fun. We will consider skipping over Colorado to
Wyoming and coming back in Spring, if we have weak layers. If we start
on November 15th, it is possible that we'll make it to central Colorado
by Christmas. Being past the San Juans by then would be a relief to me,
knowing that the notoriously bad snowpack would be behind us. If it's a
low snow year, we still may not have been able to ski. I hope for plenty
of snow and a stable snowpack in Colorado.</p>
<h1>Path and Terrain</h1>
<p>The terrain along the CDT is typically mellow, avoiding the common ski
objectives which are often a short distance away. I plan on deviating
from the classical CDT path to avoid avalanche risks and to chase good
snow. This will depend also on my partners.</p>
<p>For example, the CDT path through the Wind River range could not be more
gentle given the surrounding terrain. I guess that by the time we get
there, we may be itching for more ambitious path. We'll see then and
there what makes sense.</p>
<h1>Principles</h1>
<ol>
<li>Safety first.<ul>
<li>If we need to wait out a vicious storm cycle in a ski town, we
    ride powder until the snow settles. I carry a helmet, ice axe,
    beacon, probe, proper shovel, ski goggles, satellite
    transceiver, etc. Safety first.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proper planning.<ul>
<li>Food, fuel, weather, and above all time planning are our tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speed is safety.<ul>
<li>Weather changes, gear fails, people fall ill. Speed is our
    friend. Slowness begets slowness. We need to be fast. 2000
    vertical feet (600 meters) gain per hour with a load (10kg) and
    a good track should be possible when needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redundant systems.<ul>
<li>Redundancy in navigation, shelter, and sleeping systems is
    important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social coherence trumps fun.<ul>
<li>We stick together within reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rest is very important.<ul>
<li>We need to ensure we can handle a 10-day traverse in deep snow.
    Thorough nightly rest is important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Systems</h1>
<ul>
<li>Light backcountry skis with scaled bases and climbings skins. Scaled
    bases are necessary for efficient.<ul>
<li>I am open to backcountry cross country skis for certain
    sections. But I trust lightweight touring skis and can
    comfortably skate with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tent. My choice: HMG UltaMid 2. Candidates: Tarptent Stratospire Li
    shell, Durston X-mid 2 shell (or Pro gutted)<ul>
<li>Also, I have tried digging a snow cave every night. It is too
    much work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zipperless down sleeping bag (-20°F) with DCF vapor barrier
    clothing. Timmermade gear serves me very well.<ul>
<li>I have tried extending all the 3-season ultralight systems for
    winter and failed. This is my current trusted system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Melt snow, heat water: MSR reactor. An (additional) option is using
    a foldable Nalgene cantene between the back and backpack (and
    combine no cook with cold soak). It is essential to plan in water
    collection at flowing waters. Otherwise, we carry too much fuel.<ul>
<li>I have tried the trail designs fissure alcohol systems for
    winter traverses. They work well, but are fidgety, slow, and
    stink too much to use in a tent. I think the MSR reactor works
    better for the weight and is more versatile (cook/hang in tent,
    fuel-to-snow-melted ratio). 50g of fuel per person per day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Finances</h1>
<p>Without the gear investments (about 8k$ upfront!), I would budget 10k$.
Weather-driven stays in town are a variable that may inflate that
number. I still need to research what permits will be necessary for
certain sections.</p>
<h1>People</h1>
<p>Myself: Experienced alpine winter backcountry <strong>tour</strong> guide,
splitboarder, skier, powder hound, climate activist. I am 37 years old,
a climate scientist turned firmware engineer, a little over 6' (184cm),
75kg, and injury-resistant and well-conditioned. I was born in New
Mexico, and live in Switzerland with my wife, with no kids.</p>
<p>I have been out in the snow since 2015 every winter for ski touring
&gt;50 days each season. For weight and efficiency reasons, I learned
how to ski recently, after 9 years of snowboarding and 9 years of
splitboarding. Skis just make more sense for traverses; therefore, I
ski.</p>
<p>I have never walked any of the long trails. I plan to when I am older. I
have done multiple ski traverses in Switzerland and Bulgaria. I truly
enjoy being out in the wild, especially in winter. My favorite thing to
do is a ski traverse. I view an attempt to walk the CDT in winter as a
string of ski traverses.</p>
<p>You: Experienced winter backcountry <strong>ski</strong> tourer. You should be
passionate about winter, cold-resistant, have a positive outlook and be
full of energy.</p>
<h1>Fundraiser</h1>
<p>I sure would like to take the opportunity set a fundraiser challenge and
have people join me in donating money to a cause. My best idea is to
find an organization the supports less fortunate communities to build
out their renewable energy mix, with the goal of long-term energy
autonomy. I am open to ideas. I guess I'd donate a dollar per mile
progress.</p>
<h1>Interested in joining me?</h1>
<p>I will only do the CDT in winter if I have a partner. If you are
interested, please read through <a href="../responses-to-obvious-questions">responses to obvious
questions</a>, and take time to reflect
and decide. Let's talk. We should take one of the <a href="https://UphillAthlete.com">Uphill
Athlete</a> courses (probably the <a href="https://uphillathlete.com/grand-traverse-ski-training-plan/">12 Week Grand
Traverse Training
Plan</a>)
together at the very least.</p>
